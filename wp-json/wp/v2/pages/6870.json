Respondents came from five regions of the globe and more than 50 countries.<\/p>\n<p>The report adds new insights to this ongoing agent debate, focusing the conversation directly on student experience, and highlighting voices from parts of the world where the use of education agents is seldom researched or written about. Researchers found that about 23 percent used agents during the application process.
