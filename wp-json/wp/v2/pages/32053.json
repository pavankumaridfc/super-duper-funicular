Jason Crow (D-CO), Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), John Katko (R-NY), and Young Kim (R-CA). The bipartisan legislation would direct the United States Department of Labor to study the barriers that impact employment opportunities of immigrants and refugees who hold international credentials.<\/p>\n<p>World Education Services (WES) strongly supports this landmark legislation.<\/p>\n<p>The contributions of immigrants and refugees are vital to the prosperity of our communities and the nation\u2019s economy, particularly during this critical period of recovery in the U.S. Yet, systemic barriers, including a lack of recognition of international credentials and needed investments in workforce development and adult education, result in the underemployment or unemployment of more than two million college-educated immigrants in the U.S.; 60 percent of these individuals hold international credentials, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI). This underutilization of talent limits workforce diversity and denies communities the urgently needed social, cultural, and linguistic abilities of immigrant and refugee workers. According to MPI, it also results in more than $39 billion in forgone earnings and $10 billion in unrealized tax payments.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;WES applauds the reintroduction of the Improving Opportunities for New Americans Act, said WES CEO and Executive Director Esther Benjamin. \u201cThis legislation is critical to helping advance economic opportunity for all and redressing inequities that prevent immigrants and refugees from rejoining their fields in the U.S.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About World Education Services (WES)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>World Education Services (WES) is a non-profit social enterprise dedicated to helping international students, immigrants, and refugees achieve their educational and career goals in the United States and Canada.
