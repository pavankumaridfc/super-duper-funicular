By supporting organizations that work with immigrants and refugees who are seeking to develop civic leadership and advocacy skills so they can more effectively influence the development of programs and policies that affect them and their communities.<\/p>\n<p>In 2022, the WES Mariam Assefa Fund conducted a series of stakeholder interviews to understand what our partners and the field thought was needed to build more inclusive communities. As a result, the Fund launched a participatory grantmaking initiative and recruited an Advisory Committee that comprised immigrant and refugee leaders with deep expertise to help shape and lead this initiative. The Committee determined the need to prioritize supporting immigrant and refugee leaders to strengthen their influence in shaping their futures.<\/p>\n","col_vert":false,"col_horz":false,"col_link_txt":"","col_link_url":"","col_link_btn":false,"col_link_size":"normal","col_quote":"","orientation":"horizontal","col_border":"none","col_font_family":"Source Sans Pro","col_inner_width":"","col_classes":"","col_css_a":"","col_css":"","col_css_t":"","col_css_m":""}],"bg_color":"","animation":false,"angle":"none","full_height":false,"bg_image":false,"bg_overlay":"","container_width":"","bg_part":"","custom_css_all":"","custom_css":"","custom_css_tablet":"","custom_css_mobile":"","custom_id":"","custom_classes":"","layout_title":"Background"},{"acf_fc_layout":"column_row","title":"","title_align":"left","title_size":"normal","title_color":"","column_break":"sm","equal_height":false,"stagger":false,"gutter":"lg","equal_height_c":false,"grid_layout":false,"slider":false,"slider_mobile":false,"stagger_size":"75px","slider_show":"","columns":[{"col_type":"content","col_pull_right":false,"col_size":"4","testimonials_cols":12,"custom_pathways":false,"testimonials":false,"col_accordion":false,"checklist":false,"col_slider":false,"col_img":false,"col_img_size":"fullsize","col_img_full":false,"col_img_link":false,"col_box_style":"widget","col_style_var":"default","col_icon":false,"col_icon_hover":false,"col_icon_height":"","col_video":"","col_title":"","col_title_size":"","col_subtitle":"","col_content":"<h2>The Opportunity<\/h2>\n<p>Seven selected awardees\u202fwill receive $100,000 grants and become grantee partners of the WES Mariam Assefa Fund.
