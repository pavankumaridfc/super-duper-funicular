The WES Gateway program came about when we saw the disadvantages refugees face in resettlement when they are unable to produce credentials due to chaos in their home countries. We realized that our deep knowledge of global protocols and practices meant we could help refugees recreate missing documentation and credentials. We began with a pilot project in Syria in 2016, and now work with displaced individuals from seven countries in crisis, including Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq, Syria, T\u00fcrkiye, Ukraine, and Venezuela.
