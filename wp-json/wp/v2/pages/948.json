The research shows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most international students (88%) are satisfied with their overall U.S. educational experience, with the highest overall satisfaction rates being among Indian (94%) and European (90%) students.<\/li>\n<li>The greatest area of dissatisfaction in relative terms among broad institutional support services is career services (66% overall satisfaction rate), particularly in terms of assistance in finding employment and internships after graduation (64% overall satisfaction).<\/li>\n<li>Students from the Middle East &amp; North Africa (MENA) struggle heavily with English skills (38%), expect to improve those skills more relative to others (26%), and are relatively dissatisfied compared to others with the English language courses at their institutions (70% overall satisfaction rate).<\/li>\n<li>International students who are satisfied with their U.S. experience overall are more likely to recommend their institutions to others, including in their home countries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https:\/\/wes.org\/studentsatisfaction\">complete research report<\/a> to learn more about the international student experience in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Contact us if you have questions or would like to speak with one of our experts regarding the research report and its findings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About WES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>World Education Services enables the global mobility of students and professionals through our extensive knowledge, trusted research, and expert advice.
