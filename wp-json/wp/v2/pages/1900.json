The goal of the act is to achieve accessibility for Ontarians with disabilities by 2025. Accessible Formats include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accessible electronic formats<\/li>\n<li>recorded audio<\/li>\n<li>text transcripts<\/li>\n<li>cell phone texting<\/li>\n<li>plain language<\/li>\n<li>large print<\/li>\n<li>accessible websites<\/li>\n<li>braille<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Assistive device:<\/strong> Any device that people bring with them such as white canes, walkers, vision aids such as binoculars or monocular, magnifiers, oxygen tanks, or hearing aids.

The nature of the disability does not need to be disclosed.<\/p>\n<h3>Roles and Responsibilities<\/h3>\n<p>Management (managers, immediate supervisors, and department heads) is responsible for ensuring that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>All employees follow the guidelines articulated in this policy<\/li>\n<li>All employees are trained under AODA regulations, the Human Rights Code, and all policies, practices, and procedures as they relate to a person\u2019s specific job<\/li>\n<li>Accommodations are provided for employees with disabilities articulated under Section 7d) of this policy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All employees, volunteers, contractors and subcontractors, and any other persons acting on behalf of WES are responsible for adhering to and following the commitments articulated in this policy.<\/p>\n<h3>Training<\/h3>\n<p>WES will provide training in Ontario\u2019s accessibility laws and Human Rights Code as they relate to people with disabilities.

Accessibility will be incorporated into all emergency planning.<\/p>\n<p>If or when the organization experiences a temporary disruption of service, or access to facilities that people with disabilities may rely on has been suspended, notices will be posted in reasonable places (such as wes.org) and will include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The reason for the disruption<\/li>\n<li>The expected duration of the disruption<\/li>\n<li>Suggested alternatives that may be available to persons with disabilities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Accessible Formats and Communication Supports<\/h4>\n<p>WES is committed to meeting alternative format requests in a timely fashion that responds appropriately to any situation.<\/p>\n<p>When a person requests an alternative format, WES will consult with the individual to determine a format that is appropriate. The decision on what format to provide ultimately rests with WES.<\/p>\n<h4>Feedback Process<\/h4>\n<p>WES welcomes feedback on its customer service accessibility and how its steps to comply with AODA meet the needs of people living with various types of disabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Feedback can be provided to Human Resources via the WES website by filling out the <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/web-accessibility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>feedback form<\/strong><\/a> or by mail or email to the address below:<\/p>\n<p>World Education Services<br \/>\nHuman Resources<br \/>\n2 Carlton Street, Suite 1400<br \/>\nToronto, ON M5B 1J3<br \/>\n<a href=\"mailto:weshr@wes.org\"><strong>weshr@wes.org<\/strong><\/a><strong> \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If customers with disabilities would prefer to provide their feedback using another method and receive a response, they may request it.<\/p>\n<p>To register a complaint about the organization\u2019s accessibility to persons with disabilities, please submit the complaint in writing (by email or letter) if possible.<\/p>\n<p>Upon receipt of a written complaint, WES will follow up directly with the complainant within five (5) business days and work to resolve the issue in a timely manner.<\/p>\n<h3>Employment<\/h3>\n<h4>Recruitment, Assessment, and Selection Process<\/h4>\n<p>WES is committed to ensuring that people with disabilities have the same opportunity of access to employment opportunities as all other prospective employees. The company will ensure that in its recruitment practices the public is made aware that it will provide appropriate accommodations for applicants with disabilities in its recruitment, assessment, and selection processes.<\/p>\n<p>During the job selection process we will make applicants aware that, upon request, they have access to accommodations in relation to materials and processes that will be used for applicant selection and that take into account their accessibility needs due to a disability.<\/p>\n<p>When WES makes an offer of employment, we will notify the successful applicant of our policy of accommodating employees who have disabilities.<\/p>\n<h4>Accessible Formats and Communication Supports for Employees<\/h4>\n<p>At the request of an employee with a disability, we will consult with the employee to provide or arrange for accessible formats and communication supports in relation to information that is generally available to employees and that the disabled employee needs to perform the job.<\/p>\n<h4>Workplace Emergency Response Information<\/h4>\n<p>WES will ensure that individualized workplace emergency response information is provided to employees who have a disability, provided that the disability is such that individualized information is necessary and WES has been made aware of the disabled employee\u2019s need for the accommodation.<\/p>\n<p>If an employee who has a workplace emergency plan requires assistance, WES will, with the consent of the employee, provide such information to the person designated to provide assistance to the employee.<\/p>\n<p>WES will review individualized workplace emergency response information when:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The employee moves to a different location in WES<\/li>\n<li>The employee\u2019s accommodation needs or plans are reviewed<\/li>\n<li>The site where the employee is working reviews its general emergency response procedures<\/li>\n<li>Emergency preparedness plans are being developed for employees with disabilities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Individual Accommodation Plans<\/h4>\n<p>WES is committed to providing accommodations for employees who have disabilities. When an employee with a disability requests an accommodation, the following process will be followed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An employee may submit requests for accommodations to their direct manager.<\/li>\n<li>The employee will be required to provide sufficient medical documentation to support the need for accommodations, such as a functional capacity evaluation. A functional capacity evaluation is limited to recommendations on what accommodations the employee requires to fulfill the essential duties of the employee\u2019s job. Employees seeking accommodations are expected to fully cooperate by providing any information or medical assessments relevant to the determination of the accommodations request.<\/li>\n<li>The specific request and the essential duties of the job will determine how the manager will assess and develop an accommodation plan in consultation with HR, the employee, and the employee\u2019s health care provider(s).<\/li>\n<li>WES further reserves the right to require the employee to participate in a formal needs assessment by a qualified medical practitioner or other expert to help determine if and how accommodations can be provided. The costs of any assessment required by WES will be covered by WES.<\/li>\n<li>Employees may request accommodation plans if they have a permanent disability or if their disability is temporary; for example, the return to work program for employees returning from a medical leave.<\/li>\n<li>The privacy of the individual requesting the accommodation will be protected. Private information will be disclosed only to those necessary in the assessment and development of the accommodation.<\/li>\n<li>Accommodations may include flexible scheduling, time off for medical appointments, the provision of alternative formats, technology adaptations, rest areas, and modified job duties.<\/li>\n<li>WES will ensure that the individual accommodation plan is provided in a format that takes into account the employee\u2019s accessibility needs.<\/li>\n<li>The accommodation plan will be reviewed and updated as required, and is portable if the employee moves to a different location or position.<\/li>\n<li>If the accommodation is no longer appropriate, the employee and the manager will work together to obtain relevant information and reassess the employee\u2019s needs in order for WES to determine the most suitable accommodation measure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Return to Work Process<\/h4>\n<p>For those employees returning to work following a disability leave who require temporary accommodations, a return to work plan will be developed and documented in consultation with the employee and based on the recommendations provided by the employee\u2019s health care provider.<\/p>\n<h4>Performance Management Process<\/h4>\n<p>In administering performance management processes with respect to employees with disabilities, WES will take into account the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities as well as individual accommodation plans.<\/p>\n<h4>Career Development and Advancement<\/h4>\n<p>WES will take into account the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities as well as individual accommodation plans.<\/p>\n<h4>Redeployment<\/h4>\n<p>WES will take into account the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities as well as individual accommodation plans during the redeployment process.<\/p>\n<p>Created: January 2017<br \/>\nRevised: June 2021<\/p>\n","evaluation_reports":false,"intro_item_headline":"","intro_item_text":"","intro_item_image":false,"intro_more_button":"","intro_more_button_cta_link":"","intro_more_button_new_window":[],"intro_more_button_content":"","main_content_title":"","main_content_item_1_headline":"","main_content_item_1_text":"","main_content_item_1_image":false,"main_content_item_1_cta_text":"","main_content_item_1_cta_link":"","item_1_cta_link_new_window":[],"main_content_item_2_headline":"","main_content_item_2_text":"","main_content_item_2_image":false,"main_content_item_2_cta_text":"","main_content_item_2_cta_link":"","item_2_cta_link_new_window":[],"main_content_item_3_headline":"","main_content_item_3_text":"","main_content_item_3_image":false,"main_content_item_3_cta_text":"","main_content_item_3_cta_link":"","item_3_cta_link_new_window":[],"main_content_item_4_headline":"","main_content_item_4_text":"","main_content_item_4_image":false,"main_content_item_4_cta_text":"","main_content_item_4_cta_link":"","item_4_cta_link_new_window":[],"main_content_item_5_headline":"","main_content_item_5_text":"","main_content_item_5_image":false,"main_content_item_5_cta_text":"","main_content_item_5_cta_link":"","item_5_cta_link_new_window":[],"main_content_item_6_headline":"","main_content_item_6_text":"","main_content_item_6_image":false,"main_content_item_6_cta_text":"","main_content_item_6_cta_link":"","item_6_cta_link_new_window":[],"main_content_item_7_headline":"","main_content_item_7_text":"","main_content_item_7_image":false,"main_content_item_7_cta_text":"","main_content_item_7_cta_link":"","item_7_cta_link_new_window":[],"page_maf":false,"main_content_item_8_headline":"","main_content_item_8_text":"","main_content_item_8_image":false,"main_content_item_8_cta_text":"","main_content_item_8_cta_link":"","item_8_cta_link_new_window":[],"main_content_item_9_headline":"","main_content_item_9_text":"","main_content_item_9_image":false,"main_content_item_9_cta_text":"","main_content_item_9_cta_link":"","item_9_cta_link_new_window":[],"main_content_item_10_headline":"","main_content_item_10_text":"","main_content_item_10_image":false,"main_content_item_10_cta_text":"","main_content_item_10_cta_link":"","item_10_cta_link_new_window":[],"custom_body_class":"","hide_language_switcher":false,"custom_menu":"","alert_msg":"default"},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) -
