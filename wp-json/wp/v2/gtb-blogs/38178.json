With the labour force expected to be close to 100 percent dependent on immigration to fuel growth, the communities\u2019 need for immigrant talent has never been greater.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the ongoing Canadian labour crisis, WES launched #ImmigrantsWork to work with community partners in mobilizing local employers to co-design solutions that help identify, recruit, hire, and retain local immigrant talent. Building on the successes and learnings from a pilot phase, World Education Services (WES) is proud today to announce the names of the five new communities across Canada that will be joining the second phase of the #ImmigrantsWork initiative:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grey and Bruce Counties, <strong>Ontario\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Lanark and Renfrew Counties, <strong>Ontario\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Regina, <strong>Saskatchewan<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Tri-Cities (Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody), <strong>British Columbia<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Winnipeg, <strong>Manitoba\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cWe know that there has never been a greater need for scalable localized solutions that harness immigrant skills,\u201d said WES Managing Director Shamira Madhany. \u201cCommunities in rural and northern Canada are particularly affected. That\u2019s why we are so delighted to pursue these new partnerships with these communities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In November 2022, WES launched a call for expressions of interest (EoI) for the second phase of #ImmigrantsWork and in response received more than a dozen submissions from organizations representing communities all over Canada. Applicants had to meet certain criteria, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct experience working with local employers, including small and medium-sized enterprises<\/li>\n<li>Ties to a network of strong, locally engaged partners and stakeholders<\/li>\n<li>Inclusion of immigrant- and refugee-led organizations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>About the #ImmigrantsWork Initiative\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In late 2021, WES identified three pilot communities: the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, the Regional Municipality of Durham, and Greater Moncton. The first phase of the #ImmigrantsWork pilot program was successfully completed in 2022, resulting in the launch of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/employer-playbook\/\">Employer Playbook: Strategies for Immigrant Inclusion in Canadian Workplaces<\/a>, a digitized and localized employer resource that was well received by employers and workforce development stakeholders across the pilot communities.<\/p>\n<p>The upcoming phase of #ImmigrantsWork will sustain the momentum and build on the success of the earlier phase, testing the program in new communities that have different needs and capacities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe #ImmigrantsWork program reinforces WES\u2019 commitment to addressing workforce shortages through an innovative community engagement initiative, anchored in collective action to drive systemic change in Canada\u2019s labour market,\u201d said WES Managing Director Shamira Madhany. \u201cInsights gained throughout the work with local employers and communities will further enrich WES\u2019 policy and programmatic work with national business associations and will have a long-lasting impact on immigration and labour policy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Interested in learning more about #ImmigrantsWork?

In 2020, Grey and Bruce Counties received funding from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to administer the GBLIP\u2014a collaborative community initiative designed to fill critical gaps in the local labour force by improving the successful integration of newcomers. The GBLIP works at the local level to foster a sense of belonging and supports various stakeholders in building their capacity, raising awareness of the needs of newcomers, and supporting community-level research and planning. The GBLIP recognizes that immigration will continue to play a key role in the economic future of Grey and Bruce Counties.
