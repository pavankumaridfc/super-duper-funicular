Global Michigan\u2019s goal was to <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">address the need for bi-lingual and bi-cultural workers in state government, to improve departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 ability to provide public language access and culturally competent services. Over the course of the 18-month project, Global Michigan established a statewide immigrant professional networking group and supported job placements within state government for internationally trained immigrants and refugees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Connecting Immigrant and Refugee Candidates to Jobs Within State Government<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As part of the SIIP Demonstration Opportunity, Global Michigan approached immigrant and refugee workforce inclusion holistically with both individual and systemic perspectives. For instance, staff recruited more than 50 internationally trained immigrants and refugees to join its new Career Connectors networking group. Participants benefited from seven webinars and several office hour sessions to discuss professional development and job search strategy. At the same time, Global Michigan staff members worked with the state\u2019s Equity and Inclusion Office to examine recruitment and hiring processes. This effort led to the identification of several systemic barriers that impede applicants from marginalized populations, including immigrants and refugees. More importantly, they identified potential solutions to those barriers, and are developing a \u201cbest practice\u201d guide for hiring managers and HR employees to increase equity across state government agencies.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Finally, Global Michigan facilitated employment connections between state agencies and participants in the Career Connectors program, notifying department contacts when participants applied to state government job postings. Multiple participants in the program interviewed for jobs with the State of Michigan, and two have recently accepted positions. \u201cThe Career Connectors Program was a powerful program that I was able to use to change my professional life,\u201d said one Career Connectors graduate who accepted a job with the state. \u201cIt helped me transition to a new career and role as a Public Utilities Engineer with the State of Michigan!\u201d<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Global Michigan has since distilled the Career Connectors lessons and guidance into a resource guide, with information on networking, job search strategy, and resume building. The guide is tailored to the specific needs of internationally trained immigrants and refugees, covering topics such as how to present international education and experience throughout the job application process, and how to discuss work authorization. The guide also includes advice on writing a cover letter, examples of interview questions, and information on how to negotiate a job offer.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8220;We hope immigrant and refugee job seekers everywhere can use this guide to secure in-demand positions that align with their expertise and interests, especially within state government,&#8221; said Sharif Krabti, a program analyst at the Office of Global Michigan.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>WES Global Talent Bridge congratulates the Office of Global Michigan on the work it has accomplished during its participation in the SIIP Demonstration Opportunity.
