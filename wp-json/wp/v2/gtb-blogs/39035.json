Having earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in agriculture, he worked as a field manager with USAID for many years. He went on to study pharmacy at a private institute in Kabul. At the same time, he worked as an elementary school teacher and an interpreter with the Canadian military in order to provide basic necessities for his family.<\/p>\n<p>Arriving in Canada, Sultanzoy felt safe but also disoriented. What should\u2014and could\u2014he do to support his family now? \u201cWhen I got here, I had so many plans and hopes, but I didn\u2019t know where to start,\u201d he reflected.<\/p>\n<p>A few months after settling in Ontario, Sultanzoy began to explore ways to leverage his education and professional experience to start a new life in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to a local Facebook group, he learned about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/about-the-wes-gateway-program\/\">World Education Services (WES) Gateway Program<\/a>, which assesses academic credentials of individuals who, as a result of adverse circumstances in the country where they earned their degrees, have limited proof of their academic achievements.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a wonderful surprise to learn that there is a special program for evaluating academic degrees for people coming from countries in conflict like Afghanistan,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>He found the process of applying for the WES Gateway Program easy. \u201cI had all the necessary paperwork,\u201d he said. WES asked applicants to send digital copies of transcripts via email, and Sultanzoy found a friend who helped him scan them digitally. \u201cThe online application process was very helpful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sultanzoy had no idea how many months the evaluation process would take, until one happy day when he checked his email. \u201cI got it within two weeks of applying,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis was incredible\u2014a wonderful day I will never forget.\u201d He received an evaluation of his degree in agriculture, which he had obtained from Kabul University.<\/p>\n<p>Sultanzoy is now able to see a path forward in Canada. \u201cI would like to go back to school for a master\u2019s degree in agriculture and maybe a PhD after that. There is a lot left for me to learn in this field,\u201d he noted. \u201cWith my previous experience, I will be able to benefit Canadian society.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sultanzoy hopes that other newcomers will discover and take advantage of the support offered by the Gateway Program, especially since WES is continually expanding its list of accredited universities and academic institutions, allowing for the evaluation of more degrees and certificates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery day, people resettle in Canada due to conflicts in their home countries,\u201d Sultanzoy said. \u201cThey need someone to help and guide them in taking their first step toward building new lives here. The WES Gateway Program fills this role very effectively. It helps us to not only get started, but to become confident of a better future.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":39185,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","gtb_blog_categories":[908,1169],"gtb_tags":[781,708],"better_featured_image":{"id":39185,"alt_text":"Immigrant
