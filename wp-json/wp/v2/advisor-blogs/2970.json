You have to pay for books, room and board, and other daily expenses\u2014in addition to tuition.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily there are financial aid options that can help you pay for your education. You even may be able eligible to receive financial aid if you are an eligible non-U.S. citizen. If you are an international student, you are not eligible for U.S. federal student aid. There are, however, other sources of student aid and scholarships for which international students are eligible to apply. The following information will help you understand the financial aid options available.<\/p>\n<h4>Different Types of Financial Aid<\/h4>\n<p>There are a number of sources of financial aid, the following describes each type:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Federal aid:<\/strong> This type of financial assistance is provided by the <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/types#federal-aid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. government<\/a>. The aid can include:\n<ul>\n<li>Grants\u2013money that does not have to be paid back<\/li>\n<li>Work-study programs\u2013students receive payments for work done on campus<\/li>\n<li>Loans\u2013money that must be repaid, including interest. However, federal student loans offer lower interest rates than private (bank) loans. Federal loans are either subsidized, meaning the government pays the interest while you are studying, or unsubsidized, where you are responsible for paying the full interest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>State aid:<\/strong> You may be eligible to receive aid from the state you live in if you are a U.S. permanent resident. Visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/about\/contacts\/state\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your state\u2019s higher education agency<\/a> for more information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Institutional aid:<\/strong> The <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/types#school-aid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">university or college<\/a> you enroll in may also offer scholarships based on academic merit, financial need, athletic or artistic ability, or socioeconomic backgrounds.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Private scholarships:<\/strong> This type of financial aid is provided by different organizations independent of government or institutional aid. You do not have to repay <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/types\/grants-scholarships\/finding-scholarships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scholarship<\/a> aid or pay to apply and receive scholarship money.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Private loans:<\/strong> Some banks may offer student loans but interest rates are much higher than government loans and can be difficult to repay.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Contact the college or university you want to attend to learn more about the financial aid offered to international students and <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/eligibility\/non-us-citizens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">legal permanent residents<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can also visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Department of Education\u2019s website<\/a> for more information on eligibility.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":17264,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[448,480,397],"better_featured_image":{"id":17264,"alt_text":"Librarian helps female college student","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802-541x362.jpg"},"medium_large":{"file":"iStock-973984316_super-768x512.jpg","width":768,"height":512,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-768x512.jpg"},"large":{"file":"iStock-973984316_super-1024x683.jpg","width":1024,"height":683,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-1024x683.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"3.5","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"Canon EOS 5D Mark IV","caption":"Mid adult librarian helps a mid adult female college student, The student is asking the librarian a question.","created_timestamp":"1520024084","copyright":"This content is subject to copyright.","focal_length":"182","iso":"500","shutter_speed":"0.008","title":"Librarian helps female college student","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"post":2970,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/iStock-973984316_super-e1555710439802.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Global Talent Bridge","author":{"ID":3405,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 16:04:07","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 16:04:07","post_content":"WES Global Talent Bridge is a program dedicated to helping skilled immigrants fully utilize their talents and education in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/partners\/global-talent-bridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United States<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/partners\/global-talent-bridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canada<\/a>.
