For more information on colleges in Canada, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.collegesinstitutes.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colleges and Institutes Canada<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the specific focus on employability, colleges also tend to have smaller class sizes, with a lower student-to-instructor ratio. This is beneficial for students who learn best with individualized attention and the ability to engage more directly with teachers. These programs can also provide additional practical experience through bridge-to-apprenticeship training options as well as language and skills upgrading.<\/p>\n<p>Many international students or professionals with previous degrees also appreciate the shorter certificate and diploma programs offered by colleges in Canada. Especially in the context of continuing education and professional development, college programs can be used to complement a degree from outside of Canada as a stackable credential.<\/p>\n<h4>University in Canada<\/h4>\n<p>University in Canada refers to academic institutions that are regulated by provincial legislation but are autonomous in terms of academic matters such as quality of programs, instructors, and policies and procedures. Distinct from colleges, which grant diplomas, universities in Canada are defined as degree-granting institutions that provide bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees. Universities typically focus on analytical skills (the ability to understand and use information), and academic and professional programs. For more information on universities in Canada, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.univcan.ca\/universities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Universities Canada<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the longer length of time it takes to complete a university program\u2014typically three to four years\u2014these programs are sometimes less attractive options for international students or professionals who are interested in a quicker, stackable credential. University degrees do come at a higher financial cost than college programs but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/financial-aid-for-international-students-at-canadian-universities\">information on fiancial aid<\/a> is readily available.<\/p>\n<p>For those who would like to obtain their first undergraduate degree, or who are interested in a professional program like medicine and law, universities are a good option. Obtaining a university degree is also necessary for anyone who is interested in working in academia or research-based professions.<\/p>\n<p>With a higher student-to-instructor ratio, university programs offer more independence than many college programs. This necessitates a strong sense of time management and self-motivation. In the later years of an undergraduate program, during a master\u2019s, and doctoral degree, the amount of self-directed study increases and students are able to focus on more specific areas of interest.<\/p>\n<h4>Continuing Education in Canada<\/h4>\n<p>Continuing education and professional development are valued in the Canadian workplace, and as shared by a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/spotlight-on-success-joulaika-buchan\">Spotlight on Success<\/a>, can be a useful step in your career journey. Whether you choose to enrol at a college to obtain a certificate or diploma or at a University to obtain a bachelor\u2019s or postgraduate degree, continuing your education can lead to new and rewarding career pathways.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":10658,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[7,351,352],"better_featured_image":{"id":10658,"alt_text":"Adult students studying together in library","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2018\/03\/blog_20180329-iStock-466938728.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog_20180329-iStock-466938728-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"2.8","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","caption":"Graduate school or continuing education:  Mid adult women (30s) meeting and studying together in the library.
