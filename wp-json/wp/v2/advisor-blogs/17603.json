Accounting in the U.S. is a semi-regulated profession, meaning some accounting careers require licensure and others do not. For example, Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) must be licensed to practice in the U.S. However, each state regulates CPA license requirements and establishes its own scope of practice concerning professional licensure.<\/p>\n<p><em>Career Pathways in Accounting<\/em> can help you understand the steps involved in becoming an accountant and obtaining new accounting credentials in the U.S. It can also direct you to the appropriate licensing bodies and organizations along the way. You will find advice to guide your career whether you are just starting out or if you are already an internationally trained accountant.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/pass-cpa-exam\/\">How to Pass the CPA Exam<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If the process of earning your accounting license in the United States seems too difficult or costly, this free e-guide also outlines alternative career opportunities related to the field of accounting that let you use your transferable skills, but do not require licensing.<\/p>\n<p>Some related career examples include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Credit Analyst<\/li>\n<li>Financial Analyst<\/li>\n<li>Brokerage Clerk<\/li>\n<li>Purchasing Agent<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you choose a path, the guide will help you find state-specific information about achieving your new goal.<\/p>\n<p><em>Career Pathways in Accounting<\/em> also describes the roles and responsibilities of accountants, common job titles in the field, as well as the educational requirements and certifications necessary to qualify for different positions.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Download the E-Guide<\/p>\n<p><u><\/u><u><\/u><em><u><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/GlobalTalentBridge-eguide-career-pathways-in-accounting-using-your-foreign-education-in-the-united-states.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Career Pathways in Accounting<\/a><\/u><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>What Are <em>Career Pathways<\/em> E-Guides?<\/h4>\n<p><em>Career Pathways<\/em> e-guides are a one-stop resource for skilled immigrants who wish to apply their education and skills in North America.
