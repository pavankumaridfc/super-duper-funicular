The average GMAT score for a master&#8217;s of business administration (MBA) candidates is 640, and people who score above 700 are considered &#8220;top candidates.&#8221; So what can you do to get a higher score in a short period of time? Try using the resources listed below:<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mba.com\/exam-prep\/gmat-official-guide-2020-ebook-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GMAT 2020 Official Guide (OG)<br \/>\n<\/a><\/strong>Issued by the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the institution that organizes the GMAT, the OG is the top-recommended preparation material for the GMAT. If you have no idea how to start studying for the GMAT, try the OG first. This handbook will help you learn everything you need to know about the exam such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test structure and overview, format, and question types.<\/li>\n<li>Tips for taking the GMAT.<\/li>\n<li>In-depth math and grammar reviews, performance analytics, and more.<\/li>\n<li>Practice examinations along with full answers straight from the source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The OG has both print and mobile versions in its official guide package. The advantage of the app version of the OG is its convenience for GMAT test preparation on the go with your mobile phone. You can also embed a timer to create a simulation test environment. <strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mba.com\/us\/the-gmat-exam\/prepare-for-the-gmat-exam\/test-prep-materials\/free-gmat-prep-software.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Free GMATPrep Software<br \/>\n<\/a><\/strong>The GMATPrep Software is offered by GMAC as well, and you can download it from the GMAT website for free after creating an account on the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mba.com\/us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GMAT website<\/a>. This test prep uses the same software as the official exam. The software features 90 free questions, which includes 30 quantitative, 45 verbal, and 15 integrated reasoning, along with answers and explanations. After finishing the free questions, you are able to extend the GMATPrep software by purchasing additional questions or practice exams.<\/p>\n<p>It is highly recommended to take the practice test at least two times before you take the exam. You should take it the first time before starting your test preparation, and the second time after your test preparation. This strategy will help you know early on where you need to improve so you can be more strategic while preparing for the exam and assess your progress after.<\/p>\n<p>Taking practice tests before the official test will help you to better familiarize yourself with the format and adjust your pace to the timed exam. Many students have shared that the GMATPrep Software serves as a good indicator of official test scores so you can get an idea of your official score range.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additional Free Test Prep<br \/>\n<\/strong>If you are looking for more test preparation materials, you can also use these additional resources below.
