This includes deciding what your convictions are and how you feel about what is happening around the world. A place full of ideas, your university offers you plenty of people with whom you can debate and discuss different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mastersportal.eu\/articles\/576\/what-can-i-become-if-i-study-political-sciences.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issues around the world<\/a>. It\u2019s a perfect place to find the social causes, initiatives, and efforts you\u2019re eager to take part in or contribute to.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of students find that, during their time in college or university, there are plenty of ways to get involved in protests, marches, sit-ins, rallies, lectures, and fundraisers. But, where do you start? Here are some tips and ideas for how you can begin your efforts to create a better world and bring awareness to something you\u2019re passionate about.<\/p>\n<h4>Find Organizations Associated with Your University<\/h4>\n<p>At the start of the school year, as everyone is forming friendships, joining fraternities and sororities, and signing up for classes, there is also time to see what kinds of clubs or organizations already exist on your campus. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bachelorsportal.com\/articles\/199\/seven-good-reasons-to-join-a-student-organisation-during-your-studies.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University organizations<\/a> aren\u2019t just made up of fraternities and debate clubs (although these groups do\u00a0participate in a lot of social outreach); there are also groups devoted to specific issues and political perspectives.\u00a0Whether it\u2019s a religious group, an environmental advocacy group, or a group celebrating a particular ethnic or cultural heritage, there are plenty of people who are eager to put on events, fight for different issues,\u00a0and have their voices heard. Because universities are often diverse places, full of students from all over the world, you\u2019re sure to find groups who will happily welcome like-minded members and people who are willing to work hard for their cause.<\/p>\n<h4>Start Your Own Organization<\/h4>\n<p>After you\u2019ve looked into the organizations that your university offers, you may find that there aren\u2019t any that suit you. Perhaps you\u2019ve explored the groups that appeal to you, but then decided you would rather establish your own group instead. Either way, it\u2019s important that you find a comfortable home for you to express your\u00a0ideals\u00a0and convictions; and perhaps there are people just as disgruntled and passionate as you are, who would happily join your group. Once you\u2019ve started your own organization, you can establish the tenets and constitution for that organization, giving you the ability to bring attention to whichever social cause you find yourself advocating for.<\/p>\n<h4>Stay Informed About Events Happening on Campus<\/h4>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have the time to join (or form) organizations and participate in regular meetings, you can still find out what kinds of events different organizations are hosting. You may find that, although you don\u2019t want to join the Sustainability Organization, you may still want to join their rally on smart consumption or alternative energy. Great! Try to be in contact with someone in that group, so that even if you can\u2019t be an official member, you can still show your support and solidarity when they host an event. Subscribe to their newsletter, join their Facebook page, or simply find someone in the group who will happily bring you to an event. After all, these events are always better with more people. They would be happy to have you there with them!<\/p>\n<h4>Learn the Rules and Regulations about Protests and Rallies at Your University<\/h4>\n<p>Throughout North America, universities are often public spaces, allowing anyone to walk in or out as they please (with a few restrictions). Still, when it comes to organizing marches, rallies, and protests, universities have specific provisions about what you\u2019re allowed to do and what you\u2019re prohibited from doing. Make sure you know what the rules and regulations actually are. If you stay within those rules, you can be sure that your rights will be upheld and that the university cannot get in the way of your organization, cause, protest, or rally. In addition to following the rules and making sure you can continue your fight for justice, try to be as peaceful and safe as possible. Keep in mind that violence, rioting, and harassment are prohibited at all universities.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Tip: Use the university\u2019s rules to your advantage! If you\u2019re given only a small space to hold a peaceful protest or rally, pack as many people in as you can. It will draw more attention to your cause.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Make Sure You Know the Cause You\u2019re Fighting For<\/h4>\n<p>College is the perfect time in your life to fight for a cause; it\u2019s a wonderful occasion to be a part of\u00a0widespread\u00a0social\u00a0change or to bring attention to the issues surrounding our lives. But, social politics and social issues are often very complex, with little certainty about who or what is involved or affected. It\u2019s important that the social cause you are urging everyone to fight for or care about is actually something with which you\u2019d like to associate.<\/p>\n<p>Many times, groups don\u2019t outwardly express what their platform or agenda involves. Often, although they suggest fighting for good causes or noble ideas, many groups are also involved in violence or other illegal activities. Be sure to do your research before joining any specific efforts, marches, or initiatives. This is not to say that you have to join groups just because everyone will approve of\u00a0it, but\u00a0you don\u2019t want to join groups whose interest can end up harming others or harming the things you actually believe in.\u00a0It\u2019s also important that you know as much as possible about the issue that you\u2019re trying to confront. Global politics and social issues are often extremely<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important that you know as much as possible about the issue that you\u2019re trying to confront. Global politics and social issues are often extremely\u00a0complex and don\u2019t always have a clear good or bad side. So, if you\u2019re interested in joining a social cause on campus, and being a part of\u00a0something that you find important, you\u2019re encouraged to do so! Just be sure you take the extra steps to be informed and prepared.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":9174,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[548,135],"advisor_tags":[397,446,391,478],"better_featured_image":{"id":9174,"alt_text":"college students smiling with globe","caption":" ","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"1.4","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"NIKON D800","caption":"teenagers college student smiling with globe","created_timestamp":"1435248902","copyright":"franckreporter","focal_length":"35","iso":"125","shutter_speed":"0.0015625","title":"teenagers college student smiling with globe","orientation":"1","keywords":["Beautiful","African Descent","Cartography","Adolescence","Teenagers Only","Human Resources","Student","University Student","Arms Outstretched","Teenage Girls","Women","Females","Men","Group Of People","Community","Topography","18-19 Years","Teenager","Smiling","Laughing","Arms Raised","Standing","Playing","Moving Up","Holding","Fun","Caucasian Ethnicity","Multi-Ethnic Group","Teamwork","Partnership","Unity","Togetherness","Variation","Joy","Happiness","Friendship","Care","Sphere","Environment","Education","Lifestyles","Outdoors","Low Angle View","Cheerful","Human Hand","People","Sunlight","Sunset","Day","Planet - Space","Campus","Park - Man Made Space","Globe - Man Made Object","Sustainable Resources","Diverse"]}},"post":9173,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/blog_20171012_iStock-478824704.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"StudyPortals","author":{"ID":7807,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-08-04 15:55:53","post_date_gmt":"2017-08-04 15:55:53","post_content":"StudyPortals is the global education search platform enabling students worldwide to search for English-taught <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mastersportal.eu\/?utm_source=WES_Advisor_Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">degree programs anywhere in the world<\/a>.
