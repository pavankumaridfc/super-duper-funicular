To complete the process as easily as possible with World Education Services (WES), you must carefully follow all of the instructions during the application process. However, if you still have questions, this blog post might offer some answers for you!<\/p>\n<p>Keep reading for answers to your frequently asked questions (FAQs) about getting an Indian credential evaluation from WES.<\/p>\n<p>(If you did not study in India, please review our <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Required Documents<\/a>\u00a0page for the most up-to-date information for your country.)<\/p>\n<h4>WES Credential Evaluation Criteria for India-Educated Applicants<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Does WES evaluate my college or university?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WES has evaluated documents for thousands of individuals educated in India. If you attended a duly authorized and recognized institution, it is likely that WES can evaluate your documents.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I completed a research-based program that did not issue a transcript. Can I still get an evaluation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, WES can evaluate research-based programs. Please send us a degree certificate by postal mail and send <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required\/degreeConferralConfirmation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>this form<\/strong><\/a> directly to WES in a sealed and stamped envelope.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/send-documents-sealed-envelope\/\">What Is a Sealed Envelope?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Document Requirements<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Do I need to send transcripts or mark sheets?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WES accepts both consolidated transcripts and yearly mark sheets, provided they are issued by degree-granting institutions and sent in a sealed envelope. Institutions can also send documents electronically once they have established a digital partnership with WES.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I have a master\u2019s degree. Do I need to send my bachelor\u2019s degree, as well?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The following criteria will help you determine if you need to send your bachelor&#8217;s degree documents:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You do <strong>NOT<\/strong> need to send your bachelor\u2019s degree documents if you have one of the following degrees: Master of Education, Master of Engineering, Master of Philosophy, or Master of Technology.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a master\u2019s degree from India, and it does not fall into the categories above, you <strong>MUST<\/strong> also submit your bachelor\u2019s degree documents. WES cannot evaluate the master\u2019s degree without the bachelor\u2019s degree.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you got your master&#8217;s degree outside of India, you will probably not need to send bachelor\u2019s degree documents. Our evaluators will contact you if they require further documentation for your evaluation.<\/p>\n<h4>Verification<\/h4>\n<p>Sometimes our evaluators review your documents and determine that they have further questions. WES reserves the right to verify all documents submitted for evaluation. WES will contact your institution or other authorized source to authenticate your documents. Once WES receives a response, it will proceed with your evaluation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My school has not received your email for secondary verification (VDR). What email address did you send it to, and what can I do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WES sends documents for secondary verification to the appropriate designated official at each institution. You typically do not need to take part during this transaction.<\/p>\n<h4>Document Requirements<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Why does WES verify documents? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to evaluate documents accurately and confirm that each one is valid. Because of our rigorous authentication practices, many academic institutions, licensing bodies, and immigration authorities trust credential evaluations from WES.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are my options if my institution will not send my documents directly to WES?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As of August 2021, WES accepts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/send-documents-sealed-envelope\/\">sealed envelopes<\/a> directly from India-educated applicants in most instances. Check your <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\">Required Documents<\/a> for more information and instructions.<\/p>\n<p>You can also encourage your institution to initiate a digital partnership with WES. Then, they will be able to easily transfer documents to WES electronically. To learn more, an official from your institution simply needs to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/contact-us\/\">Contact Us<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you have further questions, please refer to our <a
