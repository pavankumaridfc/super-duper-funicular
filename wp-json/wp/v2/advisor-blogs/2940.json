If you want your education to work to your advantage, you should make it easy for the employer to understand your foreign credentials. The best and most objective way to do this is to obtain a credential evaluation from a reputable credential evaluation agency, like World Education Services (WES).<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What Are the Benefits of a Credential Evaluation?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/about-wes-credential-evaluation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credential evaluation<\/a> provides a U.S. or Canadian equivalency for your foreign education. This means that an employer who is unfamiliar with foreign credentials and institutions can easily understand your background. Plus, you can compete fairly for jobs with other candidates. Even a high school equivalency may qualify you for an entry-level job that leads to future opportunities. Having a credential evaluation gives you and potential employers confidence that you meet the job requirements, even if you have a foreign degree.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How Do I Obtain My Credential or Degree Equivalency Report?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ask potential employers if they have guidelines for foreign-educated applicants. Some employers may already ask applicants for a credential evaluation. A basic or general credential evaluation is usually sufficient for employment purposes. Employers don\u2019t typically need to see transcripts or grades.<\/p>\n<p>If there are no guidelines, or if you are not yet focused on a specific employer, you can obtain a credential evaluation from an agency accredited by the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.naces.org\/members.html\">NACES<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>WES is a member of NACES. It offers credential evaluations that verify and evaluate high school and post-secondary credentials from more than 150 countries. You can also learn the equivalency of your foreign education in both the U.S. and Canada by using the free <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/degree-equivalency-tool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Degree Equivalency Tool<\/a> from WES.<\/p>\n<h4>How Can I Use My Report in My Job Search?<\/h4>\n<p>You will know what jobs you are qualified for based on the degree equivalency statement on the report. Evaluate job ads with your evaluation in mind. For example, if you have the equivalent of a bachelor\u2019s degree, you might be overqualified for a job that requires only a high school diploma. Now you can decide which employers will likely value your credentials. This will allow you to invest your time in the best prospects.<\/p>\n<p>You may also add your evaluation to your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter. Mention that you have your foreign education verified and evaluated and that you meet the education requirements of the job. You can even include the U.S. degree equivalency in the education section of your resume, next to your degree.<\/p>\n<p>When you have a job interview, you can speak about your foreign education with confidence. Bring a copy of your evaluation to show the interviewer. Don\u2019t forget to highlight your language skills and international experience as well.<\/p>\n<p>If you receive a job offer, ask if you should have your official report sent directly by the credential evaluation agency to the employer. Then, remember that your credential evaluation might qualify you for a higher starting salary. Make sure you are being compensated for the correct level of skills and education based on your report.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Are you ready to get started?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\">Apply Now<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":10220,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[214],"advisor_tags":[75],"better_featured_image":{"id":10220,"alt_text":"credential evaluation","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"3.5","credit":"","camera":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1383326097","copyright":"This content is subject to copyright.","focal_length":"142","iso":"500","shutter_speed":"0.01","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":["indoors","people"]}},"post":2940,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/blog_20160803_iStock-507332547.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Global Talent Bridge","author":{"ID":3405,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 16:04:07","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 16:04:07","post_content":"WES Global Talent Bridge is a program dedicated to helping skilled immigrants fully utilize their talents and education in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/partners\/global-talent-bridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United States<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/partners\/global-talent-bridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canada<\/a>.
