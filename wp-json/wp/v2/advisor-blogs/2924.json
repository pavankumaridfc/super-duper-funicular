Although many think cover letters are obsolete with the advent of\u00a0new employment application technologies, cover letters are actually more important now\u00a0because technology makes it so easy.<\/p>\n<p>Cover letters are an important part of the job application process for several\u00a0reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They provide a snapshot of who you are beyond the qualifications on your\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9.<\/li>\n<li>They expressly say why you want to work for the company you are applying to.<\/li>\n<li>The company can get an idea of your writing skill level.<\/li>\n<li>The company can see how much you know about them and if you researched them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Consider this scenario: If I want a job as a bookkeeper, I will go to a job search\u00a0site (like <a href=\"https:\/\/indeed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Indeed<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn Jobs<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ziprecruiter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zip Recruiter<\/a>), build my personal profile, and upload my\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Now all I have to do is search jobs that potentially fit my\u00a0skill set, and click \u201capply.\u201d It\u2019s that easy! But, when a\u00a0company calls me for a phone screening or interview, I\u2019m suddenly stricken\u00a0with fear\u2014I\u2019ve applied to so many jobs with the one-click application\u00a0that I don\u2019t even know which company is calling me! Here is where a cover\u00a0letter becomes important because it personalizes your application. Trust me, the\u00a0extra work and effort you put into your cover letter will impress employers and\u00a0pay off in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Your cover letter is the perfect way to \u201cconnect the dots,\u201d by telling\u00a0your professional and educational story, showcasing your skills, and describing how and\u00a0why you got to where you are today. The key here is to customize it for each company\u00a0you apply to, rather than just copying the same cover letter over and over. It\u2019s\u00a0a time-consuming practice, but one that will help you stand out from other\u00a0candidates.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are applying to be a program assistant at a specific company, do\u00a0your research on its services, mission, goals, client base, etc., and tailor the cover\u00a0letter based on why you want to work at that particular company, as well as why you are\u00a0a good fit for the role. For example:<\/p>\n<p><em>XYZ Organization New York, New York<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>To the Hiring Committee:<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I am applying for the position of Program Assistant at XYZ Organization. I was\u00a0referred to this position by a current employee of yours\u2014Jane Doe.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>XYZ Organization\u2019s mission aligns well with my outlook in life\u2014being a\u00a0compassionate individual, a solid contributor to society, and always striving\u00a0to make\u00a0the world a better place. If I were to join the XYZ team, I know we can make positive\u00a0strides together.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>From there, you would highlight your background (professional and\u00a0educational) and why and how you believe that what you have learned in your career will\u00a0move the company forward. In other words, you need to explain why the company should\u00a0consider you an asset to its team. Most importantly, you should show how your interests\u00a0and mission to XYZ Organization\u2019s mission make it a good match for both sides.<\/p>\n<p>It takes practice to write the perfect cover letter. To help you get started, here\u00a0are some tips to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you send the right company the right cover letter for the right\u00a0position.<\/li>\n<li>Have someone read the cover letter to look out for any grammatical and\/or\u00a0spelling errors.<\/li>\n<li>Keep your cover letter under one page.<\/li>\n<li>Do not include any pictures or intimate details (age, gender, religion, etc.)\u00a0about yourself.<\/li>\n<li>Refrain from using colorful fonts\u2014it could strain the readers\u2019 eyes\u00a0and makes the content hard to read.<\/li>\n<li>Tell only the truth in your cover letter. Be honest about your experience and do\u00a0not embellish facts about yourself.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember, your cover letter is an opportunity to show employers your creative\u00a0side, and how passionate you are about the job. It also reflects how much time and\u00a0effort you put into writing a specialized letter just for a position with them; it\u00a0shows that you are serious about joining the team.<\/p>\n<p>Make no mistake\u2014writing a great cover letter takes time and research, but will\u00a0prove incredibly valuable when it comes to getting your dream job. Pair it with a great\u00a0resume (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/12-tips-writing-effective-resume\/\">12\u00a0Tips<\/a>), and you will soon be headed toward a successful future full of interview\u00a0invitations.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in opportunities at World Education Services, visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/careers-at-wes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WES Job Portal<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":17127,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[200],"advisor_tags":[75],"better_featured_image":{"id":17127,"alt_text":"Colleagues looking at a notebook together","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":424,"file":"2016\/08\/shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142-541x362.jpg"},"medium_large":{"file":"shutterstock_40435468-768x512.jpg","width":768,"height":512,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_40435468-768x512.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":2924,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_40435468-e1555688563142.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Annie Paul","author":{"ID":3441,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 18:11:53","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 18:11:53","post_content":"Annie Paul is the Senior Human Resources Generalist at World Education Services.","post_title":"Annie Paul","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"annie-paul","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:35:59","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:35:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=3441","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"external_contributor":true},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) -
