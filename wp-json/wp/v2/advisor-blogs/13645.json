You are most likely navigating a full class schedule\u2014along with your other responsibilities. So how can you better manage your time?<\/p>\n<p>Here are four great tips:<\/p>\n<h4>1. Hang Up Your Cell Phone<\/h4>\n<p>Cell phones are a great convenience\u2014but also a significant distraction. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2017\/08\/a-sitting-phone-gathers-brain-dross\/535476\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studies show<\/a> that even when you are not using it\u2014even if it is turned off\u2014a cell phone in the room can diminish a person\u2019s ability to learn, concentrate, or even hold a conversation!<\/p>\n<p>The best advice? Put your cell phone in another room when you are studying\u2014or leave it home and head out to the library. Think you can use your phone to schedule classes or to set reminders to do schoolwork? Maybe. But your best bet is putting distance between you and your phone if you want to ace your classes.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Establish a Routine\u2014and Stick to It<\/h4>\n<p>Getting into a routine is one way to support your study schedule. A routine can reduce uncertainty about when you are going to study or work on assignments. Establish a routine at the beginning of the semester. Be sure to plan your day around school and schoolwork\u2014remember, that is why you are in college in the first place.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Make Healthy Choices<\/h4>\n<p>This may seem like advice that would not help with time management, but making healthy choices is important. Regular exercise can keep your energy level high and your mind clear and more engaged\u2014which will improve your performance in school and consequently your grades. Another healthy choice is getting enough sleep every night. Everyone performs at their best when they are well-rested.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Use Checklists<\/h4>\n<p>Develop a checklist for each of your classes to ensure that nothing gets overlooked. Of course, complete your assignments according to their deadlines. Color coding assignments may also help you better visualize what needs to be done and when.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important skills a student can develop in college is time management. This skill helps students to succeed in class by ensuring that each assignment gets the time and attention it needs and is completed on time. To succeed in college\u2014and in life\u2014master the skill of time management.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/tips-for-staying-organized-in-college\/\">Tips for Staying Organized in College<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/how-to-survive-your-first-year-of-college\/\">How to Survive Your First Year of College<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":13679,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[397,391],"better_featured_image":{"id":13679,"alt_text":"time management tips for students","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":13645,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/blog_20181018_shutterstock_63419437.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Maddy Lavoie","author":{"ID":12223,"post_author":"86","post_date":"2018-08-13 12:43:19","post_date_gmt":"2018-08-13 16:43:19","post_content":"Maddy Lavoie is an international student-athlete at Delta State University in Mississippi.
