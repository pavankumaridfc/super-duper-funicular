Read more below about match, reach, and safety schools and how many you should apply to in each category.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Match<\/strong><b>:\u00a0<\/b>The Princeton Review defines a \u201cmatch\u201d school as one \u201cwhose admissions standards resemble your credentials.\u201d This means that when you apply, your standardized test scores, your grades, and the rigor of your classes are on par with others who have been admitted. Of all three categories, you should focus mostly on match schools, applying to at least three to five, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.princetonreview.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Princeton Review<\/a>.<br \/>\n<b><br \/>\n<\/b><strong>Reach<\/strong><b>:\u00a0<\/b>Your reach schools are the ones where you probably have less of a shot at being accepted\u2014but why not apply anyway? Still, the school you\u2019re applying to shouldn\u2019t be a totally implausible goal; that would be a waste of time, energy, and maybe even some money. So, it\u2019s important to be realistic. Don\u2019t apply only to your dream schools, but if you think you have a chance\u2014even a small one\u2014it\u2019s better to apply than live with regret.<\/p>\n<p>As the Princeton Review states on its website, \u201cA reach school is one where your academic credentials fall below the school\u2019s range for the average freshman. Reach schools are long shots, but they should still be possible. If you have a 2.0 GPA, Harvard is not a reach school\u2014it\u2019s a dream.\u201d<br \/>\n<b><br \/>\n<\/b><strong>Safety<\/strong><b>:\u00a0<\/b>A safety school is exactly what it sounds like: one where you believe you have a good chance of being accepted. Basically, your numbers should exceed the averages. But keep in mind that you aren\u2019t applying for no reason. You should still have an interest in the school in the case that you aren\u2019t admitted to your reach or match schools.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":4594,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[389],"better_featured_image":{"id":4594,"alt_text":"University sign in autumn","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"4.8","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"NIKON D80","caption":"University sign in autumn","created_timestamp":"1227859200","copyright":"sshepard","focal_length":"48","iso":"100","shutter_speed":"0.004","title":"University in Autumn","orientation":"1","keywords":["Architecture And Buildings","Autumn","Campus","Curve","Education","Education","Education Building","Industry","Information Sign","Leaf","Office Buildings","Overcast","Selective Focus","Sidewalk","Sign","Street Light","Tree","University"]}},"post":4553,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/blog_20170530_iStock_7901834.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Advisor","author":{"ID":3295,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_content":"WES Advisor is an initiative of World Education Services, a non-profit organization with over 45 years of experience in international education.
