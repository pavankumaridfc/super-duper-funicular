Most U.S. university websites include application instructions and requirements. The usual requirements are an academic transcript, test scores, statement of purpose, r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and payment of the application fee.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Planning is essential for a smooth and successful university application process. Below are some of the most important considerations when you are applying to a U.S. university as an international student.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"3\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Application Deadlines<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In some cases, U.S. universities have different deadlines for international students and U.S. residents. Each university has its own application deadlines, but most accept applications for either spring or fall admission. Refer to the university website for specific deadline details.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You might also check to see if the U.S. university you\u2019re applying to offers options for early action or early decision. This means you can get an early admission decision. However, make sure to confirm the details with the university. Early decisions are generally binding; that is, if you are accepted, then you are required to enroll in that institution. Early action allows more flexibility, and you can consider offers from other schools.

This saves you time and effort as you consider different U.S. study options.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"3\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Obtain a Credential Evaluation<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When applying to a U.S. university, you will be required to provide an evaluation of your international education and credentials.

Obtaining your credential evaluation report early will help you avoid delays and allow you to focus on all the other application requirements.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"3\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Standardized Tests and Language Requirements<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As you apply to U.S. universities or colleges, you will need to show proof that you passed standardized tests and met language requirements. If you plan to enter an undergraduate program in the U.S., you should submit your SAT or ACT scores. For graduate programs, you need to take the GRE or GMAT, depending on the program you\u2019re applying to.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">International applicants also need to show proficiency in the English language. You can comply with this requirement by passing one of the commonly accepted English language tests, such as IELTS Academic, PTE Academic, TOEFL iBT, and C1 Advanced.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"3\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Student Visa<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You need to be accepted by a U.S. university in order to apply for a student visa, so this is usually one of the final steps in the application process. The university will provide you with the acceptance letter<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u2014<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">usually as a <a href=\"https:\/\/studyinthestates.dhs.gov\/students\/prepare\/students-and-the-form-i-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Form I-20<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/j1visa.state.gov\/participants\/how-to-apply\/about-ds-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Form DS-2019<\/a><\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u2014which you will present to the U.S. embassy when you apply for your student visa.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"3\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Financial Aid and Scholarships<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The cost of living in the U.S. and your tuition fees could be higher than you expected, so it is common for international students to apply for scholarships or financial aid. Visit the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/educationusa.state.gov\/financial-aid\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Education USA website<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to search for financial aid opportunities or contact your institution directly and ask about any scholarships, grants, or other aid it may offer.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Ready to take the next steps in your educational journey?
