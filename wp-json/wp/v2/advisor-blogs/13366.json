We will reach out to you via email and My Account to notify you if any action needs to be taken.<\/p>\n<p>Below are answers to frequently asked questions often raised once applicants have sent their documents to WES:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>I ordered a Canada evaluation but accidentally sent my documents to the U.S. office. What should I do?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>You do not need to do anything. We can process documents in either office.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>I made a mistake on my online application. How can I fix it? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>While your evaluation is being processed you can log into your <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\/login\/login\">account<\/a> to order <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/wes-international-credential-advantage-package\/\">ICAP<\/a>, change your contact information, request extra sealed envelopes, add a recipient, order extra copies of your report, alter your delivery options, and make payments.<\/p>\n<p>Other change requests must go through our Customer Service <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/contact-us\/\">contact form<\/a> under the \u201cOther\u201d question category.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How do I know that WES received my documents?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you order tracking services, you can use the tracking number to monitor your documents as they make their way to our office.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>My documents arrived at WES, but my status has not changed.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>It takes two to three business days for our staff to process documents after they arrive at WES. You will receive a status update once documents have been processed and are active in our system.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>I have documents from multiple schools, and I will be sending them separately. How will WES handle these documents?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Our evaluators will review the documents they receive. If documents are still missing, your file will be put on hold. Once our evaluators receive the required documents for the other credentials that will appear on your report, they will resume working on your file.<\/p>\n<p>There is no deadline to submit your documents since your account will always remain open. However, we encourage applicants to prepare and send their documents\u2014in the required format as specified on our website\u2014as early as possible. An early start will minimize potential delays. More importantly, it will give our evaluators more time to produce a high-quality evaluation report.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a
