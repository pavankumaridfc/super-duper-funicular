One of the questions we asked was:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u201cWhat information or advice would have helped you before immigrating?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although we promised not to use real names, we are happy to share their answers with you.<\/p>\n<p>Please enjoy these excellent pieces of advice from real people who now live in New York City:<\/p>\n<h4>Pre-Arrival Advice<\/h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20585 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/shutterstock_329438618-e1570726510212.jpg\" alt=\"immigrant advice\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Start English courses before arriving in the U.S.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Almost every immigrant we interviewed recommended learning English as soon as possible\u2014before you leave home. Do not wait until you arrive in the United States. It will make it harder for you to find housing, look for jobs, and connect with others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make a timeline, and stay organized. <\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cI\u2019d say make a timeline. [Organize] the things that you need to do: \u2018By this time, I should probably have figured out a place to stay.\u2019 Or: \u2018By this time, I should have done this\u2014A, B, C.\u2019 [\u2026] And then always know what you want to do six months ahead, and make sure that you\u2019re planning for that right now. Because nothing happens at the last minute, and everyone has planned well ahead. So should you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Start applying for jobs sooner and be proactive.<br \/>\n<\/strong>One immigrant recommended looking for jobs before you leave home. You should start building your professional networks in advance, so that you can rely on them once you arrive in the U.S. If you start after you arrive, you might have to accept a \u201csurvival job\u201d that is not compatible with the work you were doing back home, your educational background, or the salary you were hoping to earn in the United States.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Start working hard early, so you will form good habits. <\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about having focus and being at your best in anything you do. Because you definitely use that. [\u2026] Whatever I am doing now will definitely help me in the next 5-10 years. So, that\u2019s advice I can make to anyone who wants to come here. Because it\u2019s a lot of hard work. [But] you\u2019re not going to come here overnight and just be hardworking. You have to start it from wherever you are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learn about services and programs that can help you settle.<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of using Google to search online about immigration services before I came here. It just didn\u2019t appear to me, because there was a lot to do before you travel.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Job Search Advice<\/h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20579 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-483572271-e1570726163601.jpg\" alt=\"immigrant advice\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Specialization is important.<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cBased on what I\u2019ve been observing, I think the U.S. job market is really about specialism all the time. [\u2026] I think, for me, if I had maybe that insight before moving here, I would\u2019ve tried to specialize specifically in one particular thing, instead of taking projects here and there, which is not building any one special, strong skill.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speak up for yourself and promote your skills.<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cIf you work for many hours, and if you don\u2019t really let other people know what you\u2019re doing, and how it benefits other staff in the company, then people might not understand the whole thing that you\u2019re working for. [\u2026] Because of the language limitation, as immigrants, we\u2019re probably not able to defend ourselves fully, and that\u2019s definitely one source of frustration. But [if] you really can go into the facts and then talk about things logically to convince others, I think that\u2019s really, really useful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Networking is essential.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Join LinkedIn. Introduce yourself to people in your field. Show people your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. In America, that\u2019s one of the primary ways that people get jobs\u2014not through job ads, or through your skills, but through other people. It\u2019s the best way to hear about job openings, be referred for positions, and secure job interviews.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Obtain certifications that can make you a more competitive job candidate.<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cGet some certificate or license. It\u2019s not necessary for every job, but sometimes they post a requirement that is a specific license or certificate that is required.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are diverse workplace cultures\u2014so find the right one.<br \/>\n<\/strong>One immigrant said that his first boss made him work too many hours\u2014and he thought that was just the way things were in the U.S. He was shocked when his next job was much more relaxed! While some workplaces do expect staff to work long hours, and some bosses are strict, workplace culture is different in every company. This means you have the freedom to find a work environment that makes you feel comfortable and happy. Even in a \u201csurvival job,\u201d it is important to work with people you respect and trust. Additionally, it&#8217;s important to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/general\/aboutdol\/majorlaws\">know your rights<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Cultural Advice<\/h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20588 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-628547660-e1570727268513.jpg\" alt=\"immigrant advice\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Read the newspaper.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Even if you already have good speaking skills, this will help you improve your grammatical English. Plus, it keeps you informed and gives you topics to discuss with friends, colleagues, and clients.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Socialize by learning about the culture.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Knowing about history, politics, and current events makes you feel more committed to your community. It also helps you get more involved socially; people bond when they realize that they have shared interests.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ask people to do things for you, without owing them anything in return.<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cAs an immigrant, I would think I probably didn\u2019t have anything to exchange for [people\u2019s time], but I found out that a lot of companies have programs for their staff to donate time to immigrants. They just simply want to give you their advice. I think it\u2019s probably human nature, part of human nature that people want to share a little bit of themselves and feel good about helping others a little bit, so use that as a resource.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Expect friendliness from people, even at work.<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cEverybody has been very nice, and they\u2019ve been talking to me, just making small talk. That, we don\u2019t do in our country. You don\u2019t talk that much to your boss. And my boss has been taking me out to lunch and just talking to me about personal things. So that\u2019s surprising.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>You can be yourself.<br \/>\n\u201c<\/strong>I think the most important one is be confident about your choice, that you choose to be here, or to be anywhere in the U.S.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>College Advice<\/h4>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20582 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-508454970-e1570726377474.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Get housing that is close to school.<br \/>\n\u201c<\/strong>I realized that even though it might be more expensive to live a little closer to the university, it\u2019s so much better and so much easier, because you don\u2019t have to spend so much time on the subway. It affects your mood, the less time you spend in the subway, and I feel like I would\u2019ve been a lot more productive if I had lived closer to my school.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learn to use the technology that will make your life easier.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Specifically, the immigrants we interviewed suggested using Google Maps, LinkedIn, MeetUp, Twitter, and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Set clear goals about what you want to accomplish.<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cIt\u2019s a big decision, coming here, so make sure that you have concrete reasons for why you want to come to the program that you have chosen. [\u2026] You need to be clear with yourself what things you want to do. You sit down and make your solid timeline. Because we have a little time. And time is irretrievable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be realistic with your expectations.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Many immigrants became familiar with the United States through the movies\u2014but they want you to know that real life is not like what you see on TV. You are not going to own a giant apartment and be constantly shopping and going out. Real life is harder and much more expensive. But setting realistic expectations will help you navigate and enjoy every step of your journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prepare to budget.<\/strong><br \/>\nOn a similar note to the advice provided above, the international students we spoke to wanted to let you know that you will not be able to live like students do on TV. You will need to learn to budget, especially if you move to a big city like New York City. International students have restricted working options while they are in school, so your spending money might be more limited than some of your peers. It helps to make friends with individuals who have similar financial situations to yours, so nobody feels left out.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/50-tips-for-international-students\/\">50 Tips for International Students<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/100-tips-for-immigrants\/\">100 Tips for Immigrants<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":20601,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[548,135,200,45,152],"advisor_tags":[397,75,446,435,391,5],"better_featured_image":{"id":20601,"alt_text":"immigrant advice","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2019\/10\/iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-641081596_super-e1570729060426-541x362.jpg"},"medium_large":{"file":"iStock-641081596_super-768x512.jpg","width":768,"height":512,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-641081596_super-768x512.jpg"},"large":{"file":"iStock-641081596_super-1024x683.jpg","width":1024,"height":683,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/iStock-641081596_super-1024x683.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"4","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"Canon EOS 5D Mark IV","caption":"Confident African American woman leads a support group or group therapy session.
