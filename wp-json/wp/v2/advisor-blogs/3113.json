You will need to get your financial documents\u00a0together to successfully pass the visa interview. The following explains some of the common financial documents that you will be asked to show depending\u00a0on how you plan to fund your studies. You will need these documents in order to prove that you have adequate financial\u00a0resources to fund your study abroad.<\/p>\n<p>When applying to universities in the U.S., many admissions offices will request that\u00a0you submit a financial document with your application. After you are admitted, the\u00a0university will then provide you with a document known as the Certificate of\u00a0Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status-For Academic and Language Students or\u00a0I-20 for short.<\/p>\n<p>If you look in section 7 of the I-20 form provided, you will see the amount of\u00a0funding you must have available to cover your first-year expenses. This includes\u00a0tuition and fees, living expenses, expenses of dependents and other expenses. You must\u00a0be able to prove that you have immediate funds available to cover this amount.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the I-20, check with the U.S. embassy or consulate in your country\u00a0for recommendations of other financial documents to provide. Types of financial\u00a0documents can vary among countries so your local U.S. embassy will know best. However, here are some of the possibilities.<\/p>\n<p>You may need to collect some of your parents&#8217; or sponsors&#8217; financial documents. These\u00a0could include their original bank records and tax returns from the past three years.\u00a0You may also need to get their pay slips, employment letters, and chartered accountant\u00a0statements.<\/p>\n<p>Have you have received a scholarship, fellowship, assistantship, grant, or loan?\u00a0Congratulations!<\/p>\n<p>However, it is necessary for you to provide a confirmation letter or\u00a0form that financial aid will be available as long as the program is pursued.\u00a0If you have taken a loan from a bank to cover your tuition, please take your application and the\u00a0official documents which verify the loan approval with you.\u00a0If you are financially supported by an individual in the U.S., you will need to\u00a0bring a notarized I-134 form along with three years of that individual\u2019s\u00a0bank statements and tax returns.<\/p>\n<p>Paying the tuition expense in advance is a good way to show proof of funds, but\u00a0remember\u2014it is NOT a requirement to pay in advance.<\/p>\n<p>This may seem like a lot but do not get overwhelmed. Keep all the different papers and forms organized. Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":17084,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[514,485,471],"better_featured_image":{"id":17084,"alt_text":"Visa Application","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2014\/07\/shutterstock_170806586.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"shutterstock_170806586-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/shutterstock_170806586-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"shutterstock_170806586-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/shutterstock_170806586-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"shutterstock_170806586-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/shutterstock_170806586-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"shutterstock_170806586-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/shutterstock_170806586-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"shutterstock_170806586-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/shutterstock_170806586-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":3113,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/shutterstock_170806586.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Advisor","author":{"ID":3295,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_content":"WES Advisor is an initiative of World Education Services, a non-profit organization with over 45 years of experience in international education.
