The decision to accept credits earned abroad varies from school to school, but here are some of the factors many universities consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the institution you attended recognized by your country\u2019s ministry of education?<\/li>\n<li>Are the courses you have taken similar to those offered by the institution you would like to attend?<\/li>\n<li>Do the courses you have taken meet the requirements for the degree and major you would like to transfer into?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Many academic institutions may allow you to transfer credits but limit how many foreign credits they accept. You should contact the admissions office of the institution you want to attend to learn their policy.<\/p>\n<p>If the school does accept foreign credits, you will likely be asked to provide some or all of the following documents:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Official academic transcripts from the institution you attended<\/li>\n<li>A formal English translation of your transcripts<\/li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/about-wes-credential-evaluation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">credential evaluation<\/a> report<\/li>\n<li>Official syllabi or catalogs that describe the courses you have taken<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The process of transferring credits can be a long one and you may not know which credits, if any, have been accepted until your studies begin. However, if your credits are accepted, you can save both time and money.<\/p>\n<p>If you are an international student and want to learn more about studying in the U.S., read Education USA\u2019s series <a href=\"https:\/\/educationusa.state.gov\/your-5-steps-us-study\">Your Five Steps to U.S. Study<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":8451,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[214],"advisor_tags":[397],"better_featured_image":{"id":8451,"alt_text":"Student at a laptop computer","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"3.2","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"NIKON D800E","caption":"Cropped shot of an attractive young student working on her digital tablet at homehttps:\/\/195.154.178.81\/DATA\/istock_collage\/a5\/shoots\/785348.jpg","created_timestamp":"1427286197","copyright":"pixdeluxe","focal_length":"29","iso":"250","shutter_speed":"0.01","title":"Get your own online tutor","orientation":"1","keywords":["Beautiful","Web Page","Wireless Technology","Student","Digital Tablet","One Woman Only","Young Women","Women","Female","Copy Space","E-Mail","Young Adult","Adult","Smiling","Looking","Studying","Learning","Beauty","Ethnic","Ethnicity","Mobility","Strategy","Planning","Preparation","Determination","Focus - Concept","Concentration","Development","Happiness","Order","Neat","Part Of","Education","Technology","Research","Lifestyles","Indoors","Positive Emotion","Brown Hair","Occupation","People","House","Home Interior","University","Internet","Eyeglasses","Eyewear","Casual Clothing","Lifestyle Backgrounds","Social Networking"]}},"post":2973,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/blog_20160623_iStock-467793724.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Global Talent Bridge","author":{"ID":3405,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 16:04:07","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 16:04:07","post_content":"WES Global Talent Bridge is a program dedicated to helping skilled immigrants fully utilize their talents and education in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/partners\/global-talent-bridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United States<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/partners\/global-talent-bridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canada<\/a>.
