Since then, she has leveraged her exceptional networking skills \u2013 polished with support from organizations like WES Global Talent Bridge partner <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nywomenimmigrants.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New Women New Yorkers<\/a> \u2013 to form local professional connections and create career opportunities. The limited professional networks of immigrants and refugees are a significant employment barrier. Artemis\u2019s story offers inspiration and insights to other internationally trained workers looking to reestablish their careers in the United States. \u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">_________________________________________________________________________<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll opportunities in my life have been related to the power of networking. You never know what might come out of connecting with someone in line with you at the coffee shop. I encourage others to speak and talk to people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Artemis D\u00edaz has built a career at the intersection of events and communications, powered by a remarkable ability to connect with people. She studied advertising in her home country of the Dominican Republic and earned a master\u2019s degree in digital marketing and business management. She also earned a certificate in public speaking.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201cI had studied English in the Dominican Republic, but I forgot some because I didn\u2019t have many opportunities to practice,\u201d Artemis said. \u201cAs soon as I came to New York, I started in ESL programs.\u201d<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Artemis launched her career as a post-production assistant at a video wedding company and parlayed that experience into project and event roles in the government sector. She was a program manager or liaison with donors with the International Cooperation Aid Department at the Ministry of Agriculture in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, before putting everything on hold to get married and move to New York City.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201cMy friends asked me, \u2018Are you sure you want to do this? It\u2019s a different country, you don\u2019t have close family there. But I follow my intuition, and here I am. No regrets, and very grateful for who I have become and the people that supported me since Day One.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Initially employers rejected Artemis. She also sometimes felt \u201cshame to speak because of my English level,\u201d but she had a valuable resource that many new immigrants lack\u2014a family friend who could hire her. The friend owned a popular restaurant in Chelsea, a trendy New York neighborhood. Although Artemis was still an English language learner, she was offered a job as a coat check attendant and food runner.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As her English improved, Artemis demonstrated her qualifications and interest in career advancement to restaurant management. The restaurant regularly hosted events\u2014 Artemis recalls meeting some of the cast of a popular Netflix series on-site one evening\u2014and promoted Artemis to a role on its events team. Leveraging her experience in graphic design and events promotion, Artemis continued it to network with connections that could lead to additional career opportunities.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">After a year at the restaurant, Artemis began \u201ccontract work as an intern with a non-profit I knew from volunteering back in my country.\u201d She was soon promoted to events and general coordinator.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201cIt was a fascinating role,\u201d Artemis said. \u201cI went to the United Nations for the first time to work at an event. I met a coach who would become the most influential person in helping me rebuild my communications career. I started collaborating with her as a community manager.\u201d<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Immigrants<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and refugees often begin their job search with few local professional contacts.<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">Limited professional networks are one of many barriers that drive the unemployment and underemployment of an estimated <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.migrationpolicy.org\/research\/brain-waste-college-educated-immigrants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">two million<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> college-educated immigrants and refugees in the U.S.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Meeting the coach was a career catalyst for Artemis; she has since developed a freelance and contract work portfolio in event production with New York-area non-profits, networks, and associations. These opportunities have opened new connections for her which have resulted in referrals to additional projects.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201cI recently had the chance to work as a master of ceremonies at an event and on a golf tournament and gala dinner based on a referral from a contact I met five years ago. They are still calling me,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In addition to seeking referrals, Artemis has sought out opportunities to form connections and develop community. While searching on her computer one evening, she learned about WES Global Talent Bridge partner <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nywomenimmigrants.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">New Women New Yorkers<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (NWNY), a non-profit that supports immigrant and refugee women in meeting their career and educational goals.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">She soon enrolled in NWNY\u2019s cohort-based workforce development and readiness workshops that provide immigrant and refugee women with career-aligned English instruction, mock interview sessions, job search support, and \u2013 perhaps most critically \u2013 an opportunity to form their professional networks.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u201cI met wonderful people from all over the world. It was a great sense of community \u2013 we all were learning and supporting each other. We created a WhatsApp group to share job postings, our feedback, and check in with one another,\u201d she recalled.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Artemis is eager to continue to expand her network and career opportunities \u2013 and support others\u2019 efforts to do the same.
