You probably assumed there is one official, proper\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format, but it turns out there are three.\u00a0It can be difficult to decide which\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format makes the most sense for you. In this blog post, you will discover the\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format options and find out which ones work best for most candidates.<\/p>\n<h4>What R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Formats Are There?<\/h4>\n<p>There are three standard r\u00e9sum\u00e9 formats:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chronological (or rather <em>reverse-chronological<\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>Functional (also known as <em>skills-based<\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>Combination (also known as <em>hybrid<\/em>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One of these\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 formats works best for most people\u2014not just experienced middle management candidates, but also students, recent graduates, and entry-level candidates.<\/p>\n<h4>Chronological R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Format<\/h4>\n<p>The chronological format is the gold standard in recruitment and has been in use for the longest time.\u00a0Most people call it chronological, but technically it is <em>reverse<\/em>-chronological. You list your experience with your most recent position up top and work your way back in time listing older and older jobs.\u00a0So, why is this appropriate for entry-level candidates and future interns? There is not much experience they can list, right?\u00a0Here is the solution. If you have little to no experience, get some. I know this sounds like a catch-22 situation. (\u201cI need experience to get experience.\u201d) However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naceweb.org\/talent-acquisition\/candidate-selection\/employers-prefer-candidates-with-work-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">almost all employers<\/a> expect at least some experience even if it is not all that relevant to the job in question.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10073\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_chronological_resume.jpg\" alt=\"Chronological Format Resume\" width=\"635\" height=\"916\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_chronological_resume.jpg 635w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_chronological_resume-208x300.jpg 208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Internships matter a lot, too. Internship experience is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naceweb.org\/about-us\/press\/2017\/the-key-attributes-employers-seek-on-students-resumes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of the strongest factors<\/a> that influence decision makers. Even <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/us\/en\/pages\/about-deloitte\/articles\/citizenship-deloitte-volunteer-impact-research.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">volunteering matters<\/a>!\u00a0If you cannot really show off a consistent employment history, do not worry. Employers understand the concept of entry-level jobs.\u00a0So, here is another solution:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip #1:<\/strong> If there is any rule in writing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it is this: always put your best foot forward.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Move your education section above your work experience section. Share as much relevant information as you can. Below is an example of how a candidate targeting a job at a startup company could do it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bachelor of Commerce (Management Specialist with a concentration in Innovation and Entrepreneurship)<\/li>\n<li>University of Toronto, expected to graduate in 2018<\/li>\n<li>Relevant Coursework: Entrepreneurship, The CEO\u2019s Toolkit, Writing Reports, The Business of Software<\/li>\n<li>Extracurricular Activities: Member of AIESEC Toronto<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You want to make the most of your education\u2014do not just list the university and degree. Include more details, such as honors, accolades, as well as relevant coursework and extracurricular activities. The candidate shown above has not graduated yet, but if you have, just say you graduated and give the date.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip #2:<\/strong> Some experts argue against disclosing your GPA. However, the closer it is to perfect, the more sense it makes to mention it. Some employers expect you to.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If you really have no work experience, you can include relevant personal or school projects you worked hard on. At this point in life, employers mostly want to see that you are dependable, can work on a team, lead your colleagues, and that you can navigate the work environment.\u00a0Your work experience section can become a projects and activities section if need be.\u00a0These two sections are crucial.\u00a0If you do them right, you are already giving the employer most of what they need since they know your background and what to expect.<\/p>\n<h4>Now for the Finishing Touches<\/h4>\n<p>Include a skills section. This is where you can list any additional skills you possess and reiterate the skills you mentioned when talking about your education and experience. Do not list too many skills; focus on your strongest abilities. If the list grows too long, employers will not believe it.\u00a0Include an interests and hobbies section, if relevant. Again, many experts argue against doing so. But that is because they have seen too many r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that included generic hobbies, such as <em>reading books<\/em>, <em>listening to music<\/em>, or <em>travel<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>List your hobbies and interests only if they can help you match the company culture. Most employers are on the lookout for a perfect fit\u2014someone who shares their values and attitude.\u00a0Plus, some hobbies are more than pastime activities. If you wrote for a school journal or run a blog, that makes for a great addition to your projects and activities section.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Pro Tip #3:<\/strong> Do not try to game the system by listing overly job-specific hobbies. If you are trying to land a job as a programmer, do not say that reading books about programming is your hobby. This is implied, and it could look silly on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, now you know how to make a reverse-chronological\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 work to your advantage. You know what sections comprise a chronological template.<\/p>\n<p>What about the other two\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 formats?<\/p>\n<h4>Functional R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Format<\/h4>\n<p>This format got really popular in the nineties. The fact that it is skills-based makes it tempting. If you have little or no experience, why not focus on your abilities? Skills matter most in the end!\u00a0Not so fast.\u00a0The problem is that the functional\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format focuses on skills at the expense of everything else. You do not really talk about the jobs or education you have had, but rather tell the employers what you can do.\u00a0This makes it even more enticing to people with little or no experience. However, using this\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format means your application will read like a list of unsubstantiated claims. A <em>braggy wishlist<\/em>, to be precise.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10074\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_functional_resume.jpg\" alt=\"Functional Resume Format\" width=\"635\" height=\"1023\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_functional_resume.jpg 635w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_functional_resume-186x300.jpg 186w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember that candidate from the example above? She would say she has management and leadership skills, is an entrepreneur, and can work on a team\u2026but there would be no proof of that on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Employers would clearly see through this. They would guess she has only studied these topics, and assume she is out of touch with reality, and move on.\u00a0If you are early in your career, you simply do not have enough experience to ignore any of it on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>The functional\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format might work for candidates targeting jobs in the creative industry where portfolios matter as much as r\u00e9sum\u00e9s (or even more). However, you can still use a regular chronological r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and list any projects and freelance work you have done. Unless you have been really prolific outside of class, all these gigs can be easily included in the classic employment history section.<\/p>\n<h4>Combination R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Format<\/h4>\n<p>Can you have your cake and eat it too? The combination\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format attempts to draw attention to skills while still holding on to your regular work experience. Sounds good, right?\u00a0Yes, but this is not all that helpful for entry-level candidates and interns-to-be.\u00a0This\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 template starts with a summary of skills and qualifications. You have learned a lot during your time at university, but not enough to treat this as in-the-trenches experience, or to summarize it.\u00a0Any attempt to do so will look like a five-minute trailer for a five-minute movie.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10075\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_combination_resume.jpg\" alt=\"Combination Resume Format\" width=\"635\" height=\"988\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_combination_resume.jpg 635w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/blog_20180131_combination_resume-193x300.jpg 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Plus, chances are, your\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will go through an applicant tracking system (ATS), which is a software application that most employers use to sort and classify the many r\u00e9sum\u00e9s received for any given position. Any non-standard\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format is a gamble because if the ATS cannot parse it, it will assume your application is non-relevant and move on to the next candidate. Make it your mission to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jobscan.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pass the ATS test<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>The One Additional Section That Can Make a Difference<\/h4>\n<p>Candidates sometimes worry they will not stand out and that their\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is not catchy enough. Or that the employer will spend just six seconds on their application and move on. What can you do?\u00a0Include a heading statement.\u00a0Heading statements are sometimes referred to as <em>professional summaries<\/em> or <em>career objectives<\/em>. Although there is a difference between the two, it does not matter. In the end, you simply want to get this personal introduction right.<\/p>\n<p>Here is how you can master the heading statement:\u00a0Write three to five sentences about <em>who<\/em> you are, <em>what<\/em> you can do, and try to show <em>how<\/em> well you can do it. Although this introduction seems to be about you; in reality, it is more about the employer. Focus on their expectations as expressed in the job listing and show how you have got what it takes to excel at your new job.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example:\u00a0A candidate is targeting a job at a startup. She is looking to become a Client Account Specialist. The job clearly states that candidates have to understand how to work in client-facing roles, be tech-savvy enough (a basic understanding of Excel, social media platforms, and technology lingo is required), and know enough about accounting to resolve potential issues with invoicing. Plus, there is the standard expectation that candidates must be able to multitask and think on their feet.<\/p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"https:\/\/careers.workopolis.com\/advice\/how-to-tailor-your-resume-to-any-job-posting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">she will tailor her r\u00e9sum\u00e9<\/a> to the job description.\u00a0Here is what she could write in the heading statement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Future Bachelor\u2019s of Commerce and Management Specialist expected to graduate in 2018 with a concentration in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Experience working on a team and leading 3+ projects at the same time (AIESEC Toronto). Looking to boost customer satisfaction at DreamJobs Canada as the Client Account Specialist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>She showed off her relevant education, gave her relevant experience a plug, and did not have to say she can multitask\u2014she proved it (<em>3+ projects at the same time<\/em> while still studying!)\u00a0You will not be able to address all the expectations in the heading statement, but that does not matter. You have the whole\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to do it!<\/p>\n<h4>Key Takeaways<\/h4>\n<p>It is easy to lose focus and start looking for the next best thing. But there is no need to do so. Stick to the respected, skimmable, and efficient reverse-chronological\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 format.\u00a0Start with your most solid section (this will be your education section, quite likely). Do not ignore other sections, such as work experience (or projects, volunteer work, internships, or freelancing).\u00a0Do not forget to provide the employer with a handy list of relevant skills.\u00a0Show your cultural fit with the right interests and hobbies.<\/p>\n<p>Once you write these sections, add a heading statement up top to provide the decision maker with enough information to make them want to read on.\u00a0Do you need to go functional? No. Combination? Not really.\u00a0Stick with the tried and tested chronological\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make the most of it by including additional sections.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Article<\/p>\n<p><a
