This trend applies only to the SAT and ACT that are traditionally required by most U.S. colleges and universities. However, the English proficiency exam requirements are likely to remain in place for international students who are non-native speakers and\/or who have studied in schools with another language of instruction.<\/p>\n<p>My advice to students is to take one entrance exam (SAT or ACT) and one English language exam (TOEFL or IELTS). International students often perform better on TOEFL\/IELTS than they do on the verbal and writing sections of the SAT\/ACT exams so it\u2019s to their advantage to have that additional score. Meanwhile, the math section of the SAT\/ACT can be a great way to showcase a student\u2019s skills. The combination of the two can sometimes give the student a boost in scholarship potential.<\/p>\n<h4>For the admissions process, is it more likely that an international student who doesn\u2019t need financial aid will be accepted rather than a student who does need financial aid?<\/h4>\n<p>No. Most U.S. colleges and universities use a selection process that is \u201cneed-blind.\u201d To be \u201cneed-blind\u201d means that the school does not look at a student\u2019s financial resources when making a decision about their admissibility. As a matter of ethics, admissions decisions are always based on the academic strength and personal qualities of the applicant.<\/p>\n<h4>Is work experience required to be admitted? If they have work experience, where can students highlight it in the application?<\/h4>\n<p>For graduate admissions, work experience is valuable and sometimes critical to the application process because graduate schools are looking for dedicated professionals who have something valuable to contribute to the field. For undergraduate admissions, work experience is not necessary but it can be a great way to showcase a student\u2019s academic interests (for example, a prospective business student working part-time in a bank) and their ability to balance multiple priorities. It can add to the sense of a student\u2019s strength of character. Many applications have a place to include this under the category \u201cextracurricular activities.\u201d It would also be appropriate to include this information in the application essay or an attached resume.<\/p>\n<h4>If an international student wants to study abroad in the U.S. but is not confident about their English language abilities, what are some options for them?<\/h4>\n<p>There are many fantastic opportunities now for students that want a university degree but need to work on the English skills first. Many universities now have bridge programs or conditional admissions programs. Such programs allow you to live on campus, immerse yourself in English, adapt to university life, and transition into full-time studies. These programs offer a great way to fast-track your learning and adaptation process. I encourage students to look closely at such offers and ask good questions because not all programs are the same. I recommend programs that are based on or adjacent to the university campus, offer finite timelines, the ability to take a few credits of university coursework, and have guaranteed full-time admission at the end of the program.<\/p>\n<h4>Thank you so much for your advice. Do you have any last words of advice for our students?<\/h4>\n<p>Be persistent and ask lots of questions. Although U.S. colleges and universities are selective, they are also very interested in having you join their school! Don\u2019t be afraid to email, call, or set up a meeting with an admissions officer. We are generally friendly people who are very interested to hear from you. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you reach an obstacle or something is unclear. Navigating the admissions process is the first step in making the giant leap into a new country. Have faith that you will be warmly welcomed when you arrive and you will find your place sooner than you think. Congratulations on beginning this exciting journey!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":7092,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[389,397,5],"better_featured_image":{"id":7092,"alt_text":"Group of college students working on a project.","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"2","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"NIKON D4S","caption":"A multi-ethnic group of college age students sitting together and are working on a project from their textbooks.","created_timestamp":"1455724905","copyright":"Christopher Futcher","focal_length":"200","iso":"320","shutter_speed":"0.003125","title":"Listening to a Professor","orientation":"1","keywords":["Indian Ethnicity","Adolescence","Student","University Student","Women","Females","Men","Males","Group Of People","Auditorium","20-24 Years","Young Adult","Sitting","Listening","Studying","Learning","Asian Ethnicity","Caucasian Ethnicity","Multi-Ethnic Group","Ethnicity","Expertise","Discussion","Togetherness","Enjoyment","Love","Friendship","Education","Indoors","Recreational Pursuit","People","Lecture Hall","Campus","University","Textbook","Book"]}},"post":3126,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20140527-iStock_86293519.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Jessica Sandberg","author":{"ID":3558,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 20:47:42","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 20:47:42","post_content":"Jessica Black Sandberg is the Director of International Admissions at Temple University.","post_title":"Jessica Sandberg","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"jessica-sandberg","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:28:26","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:28:26","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=3558","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"external_contributor":true},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) -
