Once your documents have been processed, our evaluators carefully review them to produce your credential evaluation report. While you are waiting for the evaluators to finish reviewing your documents, you may have questions.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some answers to frequently asked questions that typically arise during the evaluation process:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>I would like to add or remove a credential on my application and\/or modify my date of birth or other application information.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>You can upgrade your order, request extra copies, add recipients, or make a payment after submitting your application. However, to request other changes\u2014such as adding or removing a credential, or modifying your bio-data, such as your date of birth\u2014you will need to contact our Customer Service team using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/contact-us\/\">Contact Us form<\/a>. The Contact Us form is available Monday through Friday from\u00a09:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Eastern), excluding holidays.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>My status says, \u201cWe received your documents. We are reviewing your documents.\u201d What does this mean? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The document review phase is one of the most crucial aspects of the evaluation process. Evaluators use this time to authenticate documents, ensure that all documents include the information necessary to complete an accurate evaluation, and begin to prepare the credential evaluation report. Once this phase is over, the evaluators can provide an estimated date of completion or request any additional documents deemed necessary to complete the evaluation.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>What can I do to minimize delays in my evaluation process?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If documents arrive at WES without a reference number, it takes time to match them with the correct file. Also, evaluators must request a new set of documents if any grades, course titles, applicant bio-data, or school information is illegible.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, WES must receive all payments before our staff can complete an evaluation. If our staff receives documents for a file whose payments have not yet been processed, the evaluators will put the file on hold until all payments come in.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, our evaluators cannot proceed unless they receive a full record of all the credits you have earned for each credential listed on your application. This includes academic courses but also credits earned by exam or other means. Our evaluators also require that you submit every document listed on the <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\/\">Required Documents page<\/a> of our website.<\/p>\n<p>Each document must conform to the specific requirements listed on the site. If documents are missing, or if they are in the wrong format, our evaluators will put your evaluation on hold. Then, they will notify you of your new status. They will wait to receive all the required documents in the appropriate format to continue your evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid these problems, we encourage you to carefully review our website before you submit your documents. Knowing WES requirements and following our instructions will reduce the chances that you will experience any delays.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How do I know if my documents have not been accepted?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Our evaluators will review your documents and notify you by email regarding which documents they have received, which documents are missing, and which documents have not been accepted. If a document has not been accepted, our evaluators will include instructions on how to procure or replace the necessary document.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>How long does it take to complete an evaluation after my documents arrive at WES?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There is no set time frame to complete an evaluation after documents arrive at WES. File volume, the number of documents received, holidays, and postal delivery time all affect processing times. Additionally, the evaluators require time to review all the documents and begin processing the report. They strive to be as efficient as possible without compromising quality.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/what-happens-after-you-send-your-documents-to-wes\/\">What Happens After You Send Your Documents to WES?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4><strong>How do evaluators determine credential equivalencies?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Our staff makes equivalency decisions after conducting extensive research. They research the education system of your country or territory, as well as the individual schools and programs on your transcripts. Evaluators then compare the system to the Canadian or U.S. education system and determine the best-fit equivalency.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>I received my estimated date of completion. What happens next? <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>When our evaluators finish an initial review of your documents, they provide an estimated date of completion for the report. An area specialist will then conduct further review for quality assurance purposes. They will make any necessary changes, and then send the report to print. Our staff will mail the final evaluation to you and also to any recipients you have indicated on your application.<\/p>\n<p>If you have further questions about the credential evaluation process, you can visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/help\/\">Help Center<\/a> to see the answers to frequently asked questions.\u00a0 There are resources on several topics related to the credential evaluation process, such as how to send your documents and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=umIGTaiGmJ8\">make a credit card payment<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Ready to get started?
