The Trump administration&#8217;s \u201cstrategies to clamp down on use of the H-1B visas\u201d have been cited as a cause. The recent trend of approval rates suggests that the decline could be even larger in 2019. The approval rate of H-1B visas fell from 93 percent in 2017 to 85 percent in 2018. It has only reached 79 percent through the first six months of fiscal year 2019.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. State Department has also announced a policy requiring all visa applicants to submit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/06\/02\/us\/us-visa-application-social-media.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">five years of social media information<\/a>. In a statement, the State Department said that the policy will \u201cimprove our screening processes\u201d and \u201cprotect U.S. citizens.\u201d Critics worry that the policy may impinge on privacy and free speech rights. Other concerns simply include adding another psychological barrier that must be overcome for immigrant hopefuls considering the United States.<\/p>\n<h5><strong><u>Chinese Students Warned Against Studying in U.S.<\/u><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Political and trade tensions between the U.S. and China spilled over to the higher education sector this week, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/06\/03\/asia\/us-china-education-warning-intl\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chinese Ministry of Education<\/a> warning students about the potential risks of studying in the U.S. Although the statement was not accompanied by any overt policy changes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/local\/education\/universities-worry-about-potential-loss-of-chinese-students\/2019\/06\/03\/567044ea-861b-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html?utm_term=.26e5ff7f62a0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American universities are increasingly expressing concerns<\/a> that the tensions could have further negative impacts on the already dwindling number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>International Student Decline Harms U.S. Economy<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>The recent decline of Chinese student enrollments is a dramatic example of the <a href=\"https:\/\/monitor.icef.com\/2019\/06\/us-report-puts-the-price-of-declining-student-market-share-at-us5-5-billion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-term decline of the U.S. share of the international student market<\/a>, which fell from 28 percent in 2001 to 22 percent in 2018. <a href=\"https:\/\/monitor.icef.com\/2019\/06\/us-elt-numbers-decline-for-third-consecutive-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New data<\/a> from the Institute of International Education (IIE) also indicates that the number of international students enrolled in U.S. Intensive English Language Programs fell for the third straight year. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nafsa.org\/_\/File\/_\/nafsa-losing-talent.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A recent NAFSA report<\/a> measures the costs of that decline to the U.S. economy at $5.5 billion USD. The results of a survey of U.S. higher education institutions presented in that report suggests that visa concerns and the social and political environment in the U.S. are the most significant causes of the decline.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>More Immigration News<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/immigration-updates-h1b-visa-denials\/\">Quick Immigration Update: U.S. Denying H-1B Visas to Top Employers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Canada<\/h4>\n<h5><strong><u>Canada Launches New Loan for Credential Evaluations<\/u><\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>A new loan program, funded by the Government of Canada\u2019s Foreign Credential Recognition Program, aims to help new immigrants in the Atlantic provinces get their foreign credentials and professional qualifications recognized.
