Do not worry, IELTS has provided new resources, support, and preparation services that can help you master test day.<\/p>\n<h4>The Masterclass<\/h4>\n<p>There are lots of IELTS courses, classes, and tutors. However, few are as good as the <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltscanadatest.com\/prepare-for-ielts\/free-ielts-seminars\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IDP IELTS Masterclass<\/a>, which is taught and developed by IELTS experts.

During the session, they point out critical tips, run through important strategies, and help you avoid mistakes that might cost you marks. There are also opportunities to ask any questions you might have. Be sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltscanadatest.com\/idp-ielts-locations-canada\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">register<\/a> for this free class after you register for your test. It\u2019s usually held four times a month; <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltscanadatest.com\/prepare-for-ielts\/free-ielts-seminars\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check the schedule<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Test Preparation Course<\/h4>\n<p>IDP IELTS provides an excellent resource pack to help you on your road to success. The test prep course is approximately 100 hours and is divided into modules that are 25 hours each. The modules cover the four tested skills of reading, writing, listening, and speaking. As you work through the course, you will receive detailed feedback, along with model answers for you to compare your work to\u2014be sure to take advantage of this. One module of your choice is <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltscanadatest.com\/prepare-for-ielts\/free-online-ielts-prep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free<\/a> after you <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltscanadatest.com\/idp-ielts-locations-canada\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">register<\/a> to take your test.<\/p>\n<h4>Reading and Writing Assistance<\/h4>\n<p>How well is your preparation going? This can be a difficult question to answer. This is true in all the skills, but reading and writing are especially hard to figure out. How can you know your strengths? How can you identify your weaknesses? What skills do you need to improve to get the mark you need?<\/p>\n<p>IELTS has created a new service called <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltscanadatest.com\/prepare-for-ielts\/ielts-writing-reading-assist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IELTS Writing and Reading Assist<\/a>. This service gives you practice tests and, most importantly, personalized feedback. For example, if you\u2019re strong in answering questions focused on detail, but have trouble with figuring out the main ideas, <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltscanadatest.com\/prepare-for-ielts\/ielts-writing-reading-assist\/\">IELTS Assist<\/a> will tell you. In your writing, for example, if you have difficulty in your paragraphing and essay organization, but are strong in vocabulary, <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltscanadatest.com\/prepare-for-ielts\/ielts-writing-reading-assist\/\">IELTS Assist<\/a> will tell you. It\u2019s available for both the Academic and General tests. So, not only will this service tell you what you need to improve, but it will also give you strategies and action plans to get you ready to improve.<\/p>\n<h4>Progress Check<\/h4>\n<p>Isn\u2019t it frustrating when you study and study and study but don\u2019t see the results? It\u2019s kind of like going to the gym every day and not seeing your muscles get bigger. IELTS understands. For test-takers to get the best preparation possible, they need to be able to see their success. They need to know if all the hard work is improving their score.<\/p>\n<p>So, what\u2019s the answer? In response to this, IELTS has put together an official online practice test. Your test will be reflective of a real test, but you will conduct it in your space and on your own time. What\u2019s more, your test will be marked and analyzed by official IELTS markers who will give you a band score. And here\u2019s the best part: The <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltsprogresscheck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Progress Check<\/a> provides analytics in addition to the band score. The Progress Check is a report that tells you the specific skills you did well on, the areas that need improvement, and gives you an action plan for success.<\/p>\n<h4>New Feedback on Results<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cI want to see my exam. I want to see where I did well and where I made mistakes.\u201d Have you ever said this? You spend hours, weeks, months, even years preparing, so of course you want to see your specific marks. IDP IELTS has responded to this request. Now, after each IELTS test you take, you will be given a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ieltsessentials.com\/global\/results\/aboutyourresults\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">detailed report<\/a> on your score. You\u2019ll see where you did well, and you\u2019ll also see where you didn\u2019t do well. This report, which is similar to the <a href=\"https:\/\/ieltsprogresscheck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Progress Check<\/a>, also gives strategies and action plans on how to improve your weaker skilled areas.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related\u00a0 Articles<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/ielts-overview\">International English Language Testing System Overview<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/preparing-for-the-ielts-exam\">Preparing for the IELTS Exam<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/ielts-test-day-experience\">The IELTS Test Day Experience<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/best-practices-toefl-exam\/\">Best Practices for Taking the TOEFL Exam<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/english-proficiency-celpip-test\/\">English Proficiency: Mastering the CELPIP Test<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":10342,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[452],"better_featured_image":{"id":10342,"alt_text":"Tutor helping a teen girl study","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2018\/02\/blog_20180223_iStock_79584429.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180223_iStock_79584429-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"3.5","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","caption":"Young adult African American woman is teacher's aid or tutor in high school library.
