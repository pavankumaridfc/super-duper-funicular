According to\u00a0the American Journal of Health Education, <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.umass.edu\/gwis\/files\/2015\/07\/Wyatt-Oswalt-2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poor mental health\u00a0can impact academic performance and even graduation rates<\/a>. See our tips on how to\u00a0maintain good mental health as an international student.<\/p>\n<p>International students have the unique situation of having to assimilate to both a\u00a0new school system and a new culture. These challenges have the potential to compromise\u00a0mental health, but the following are steps you can take to avoid that situation:<\/p>\n<h4>Don\u2019t Let Small Problems Become Bigger Ones<\/h4>\n<p>When you start facing obstacles, it is smart to manage them right away instead of letting them fester into greater concerns. If you find a course difficult, reach out to\u00a0your instructor. If you have roommate issues, calmly communicate your concerns.\u00a0Proactive behavior can end many long-term dilemmas.<\/p>\n<h4>Leave Free Time in Your\u00a0Schedule<\/h4>\n<p>Academic success comes from more than just attending classes. You need to finish readings, study, and also meet with professors. This is when &#8216;downtime&#8217; becomes important because you will need to take breaks when you get to the stage of applying for jobs, completing coursework, going for interviews, and networking.<\/p>\n<h4>Prioritize\u00a0Physical Health<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/psychcentral.com\/blog\/archives\/2009\/02\/25\/the-connection-between-mental-physical-health\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mental and physical health are very closely intertwined<\/a>. Taking care of your body\u00a0will help to take care of your mind. Eat balanced meals, exercise, and get the\u00a0recommended eight hours of sleep each day. These healthy habits will also help you work\u00a0more productively.<\/p>\n<h4>Determine Your Limits<\/h4>\n<p>Although it can be tempting to\u00a0take on the maximum workload, too many activities could compromise both your health and\u00a0overall success. Establish your limits and boundaries and remember that sometimes it is\u00a0better to excel in a few pursuits than having surface involvement in many.<\/p>\n<h4>Consult Your School for Psychological Services<\/h4>\n<p>Colleges have offices with trained\u00a0counselors on campus who help students deal with issues like stress, anxiety,\u00a0depression, and other difficult situations. These offices provide affordable services\u00a0and keep personal details confidential. Save your school\u2019s counseling information\u00a0and go for a visit, even if you just want to learn more.<\/p>\n<h4>Develop a Support\u00a0Network<\/h4>\n<p>International students are more vulnerable to feelings of isolation because of their distance from familiar people and practices. To minimize loneliness, join a student or community group to make friends whom you can talk to when you feel overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<h4>Create Backup Plans<\/h4>\n<p>Many issues can be handled by planning in advance. Work for the best-case scenario, but have a backup plan for what you will do if circumstances throw you off guard.<\/p>\n<h4>Have an Activity You Use to Relax<\/h4>\n<p>You may not be able to add\u00a0another commitment to your schedule, but you should have a go-to activity that helps\u00a0you unwind. It could be practicing yoga, doing art, listening to music, playing sports,\u00a0or any other hobby that you enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>School represents an important aspect of your life but remember that it is not your\u00a0whole life. Performing well requires having good mental health, and maintaining it is\u00a0the best way to invest in your long-term success and wellness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":4766,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[548],"advisor_tags":[397,391],"better_featured_image":{"id":4766,"alt_text":"Student in counseling","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"post":3054,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/blog_20160311_shutterstock_139371353.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Justine D'Souza","author":{"ID":3428,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 16:56:18","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 16:56:18","post_content":"Justine D'Souza is the Social Media and Community Management Associate at World Education Services.","post_title":"Justine D'Souza","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"justine-dsouza","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:38:13","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:38:13","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=3428","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"external_contributor":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>8 Tips for Mental Health on Campus - World Education Services<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Mental health can impact academic performance and even graduation rates.
