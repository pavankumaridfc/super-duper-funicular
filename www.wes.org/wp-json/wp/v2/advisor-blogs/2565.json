However, immigrants\u00a0who earn an education abroad and later move to the U.S. often find themselves having to\u00a0work minimum wage \u201csurvival jobs\u201d to support themselves.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imprintproject.org\/stepstosuccess\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IMPRINT<\/a>, those who received an education in the U.S. were more\u00a0likely to be employed and successful in the U.S. than those who had only earned\u00a0their education from abroad.<\/p>\n<p>A recent webinar co-hosted by WES Global Talent Bridge and IMPRINT, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C42de1nvkBk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Made In America &#8211; Credentials to Support the Skilled Immigrant\u00a0Workforce<\/a>,\u201d discussed how credentials earned in the U.S. can help\u00a0immigrant professionals succeed.<\/p>\n<table class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"height: 256px;\" width=\"403\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C42de1nvkBk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/MadeInAmerica-Webinar.jpg\" alt=\" Made In America - Credentials to Support the Skilled Immigrant Workforce\" width=\"400\" height=\"222\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"tr-caption\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Although an education earned abroad is valuable, earning credentials in the U.S. can\u00a0help skilled immigrants bridge any gaps that may exist in their background\u2014from\u00a0language to culture to technical skills\u2014and help them find success in the\u00a0American workforce. Read on to discover how some institutions are implementing programs\u00a0to help skilled immigrants earn \u201cmade in America\u201d credentials.<\/p>\n<h4>Community Colleges<\/h4>\n<p>A community college can provide services that are well-suited to foreign-educated\u00a0immigrants. Taking a handful of community college courses, earning a certificate, or\u00a0earning a short-term credential can help immigrants build layers of experience and help\u00a0position them to successfully enter the American workforce\u2014even if they already\u00a0have a four-year degree.<\/p>\n<p>Community colleges can also offer career pathways because they are deeply rooted in\u00a0their communities, and provide access to referrals and job opportunities for\u00a0foreign-educated immigrants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example: Portland Community College &#8211; ABS Career Pathways:<\/strong> Portland\u00a0Community College created a program called Adult Basic Skills (ABS) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcc.edu\/career\/pathways\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Career Pathways<\/a>. The program provides stackable, short-term\u00a0credentials in various fields of study. It also permits ESL students to take credit\u00a0Career and Technical Education (CTE) courses while they are enrolled in an academic<br \/>\nsupport course.<\/p>\n<p>The model of this program helps students quickly earn industry-recognized\u00a0master\u2019s level academic, language, and job skills. Students benefit from a\u00a0diverse learning environment, career coaches who understand their specific challenges\u00a0and strengths, and the opportunity to align their skills with American employer\u00a0needs.<\/p>\n<p>From 2011-2015, 82 percent of students in the program completed their career pathway\u00a0credential, with 88 percent continuing their education and\/or going on to work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Success Story:<\/strong> Fidel immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba in 2013 with\u00a0a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial engineering. Because he did not have the\u00a0American credentials to be an engineer, he had to work in the meatpacking department of\u00a0his local supermarket.<\/p>\n<p>To increase his skills, Fidel co-enrolled in ESL and computer and technology courses\u00a0at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sunywcc.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Westchester Community College<\/a>. There he received his\u00a0associate\u2019s degree in civil technology and went on to work for a small\u00a0construction management firm, and eventually earned his master\u2019s in\u00a0engineering at <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.cuny.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The City University of New York<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Fidel was able to be successful because he had supportive ESL and academic course\u00a0instructors, engaged in classroom discussions, familiarized himself with American\u00a0culture, and had access to community college services such as the Welcome Center,\u00a0orientation sessions, and career advising. He also used every opportunity to speak\u00a0English by engaging with other students, faculty, and administrators both in and\u00a0outside the classroom.<\/p>\n<h4>Training Programs<\/h4>\n<p>There are many different types of training programs out there that are aimed at helping\u00a0skilled immigrants acquire the specific techniques and skills they need in their field\u00a0to have a successful career in the U.S.\u00a0Training programs make it easier for skilled immigrants to overcome employment\u00a0barriers and can help them integrate into the U.S. workforce as professionals in their\u00a0field of study.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong> Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art:\u00a0Cooper Union\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/cooper.edu\/academics\/outreach-and-pre-college\/retraining-program-immigrant-engineers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Retraining Program for Immigrant Engineers (RPIE)<\/a>\u00a0formed in\u00a0the early 1990s in an effort to help skilled engineers and scientists from the\u00a0former Soviet Union find American jobs that required skills. Since its conception,\u00a0the RPIE has expanded to include international students from countries all over the\u00a0world.<\/p>\n<p>The program provides free specialized training courses, with an emphasis placed on\u00a0American standards and practices to prepare skilled engineers for entry into highly\u00a0sought after jobs. Students typically take two to three courses over a 10-month period,\u00a0which are taught by experts in their respective fields, who also serve as mentors to\u00a0the students. Students can also participate in workshops to develop their interview and\u00a0r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing skills.<\/p>\n<p>Cooper Union also partners with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.camba.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CAMBA<\/a>, a non-profit agency that connects people with\u00a0opportunities, which helps provide students of the RPIE with job services and even\u00a0placement at companies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Success Story:<\/strong> Mr. O. was an electrical engineer from Nigeria, who\u00a0previously worked in the oil and gas industry before arriving in New York City.\u00a0Unfortunately, because he lacked certain skills necessary to work as an engineer in the\u00a0U.S., and also because New York City did not have many jobs in oil and gas, Mr. O had\u00a0to take a job working as a baggage handler at an airport, where he earned only $10 an\u00a0hour.<\/p>\n<p>To gain U.S. job training, Mr. O. enrolled in the RPIE National Electrical Code\u00a0(NEC) class. When he completed the course, he was connected to a job developer at\u00a0CAMBA, who matched him with several of their employer partners. 18 months after\u00a0arriving in New York City, Mr. O. accepted a job as a junior building inspector at a\u00a0public housing company, where he is now earning an annual salary of $46,000.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign-educated immigrants don\u2019t have to settle for a minimum wage job in the\u00a0U.S. There is a need for highly skilled workers, and a \u201cmade in America\u201d\u00a0credential can provide opportunities for immigrants to achieve career success in the\u00a0U.S.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>For more information:<\/strong> This article is based off a recent IMPRINT\u00a0series, called \u201cSteps to Success.\u201d To go more in-depth with this and\u00a0similar topics, you can access webinars, reports, and other resources on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imprintproject.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IMPRINT website<\/a>.
