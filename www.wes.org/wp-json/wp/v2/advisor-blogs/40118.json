In her role, she works with and provides support to institutional partners, as well as many WES applicants undergoing the evaluation process. In this piece, she discusses one of the key benefits of a WES credential evaluation: its lifetime value.\u00a0\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I was recently<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">contacted by a university admissions officer, asking about a credential evaluation report she had just received from a candidate. The report was prepared before I joined the organization more than 20 years ago. This was a profound reminder of the lifelong value of a WES evaluation, something I talk about frequently.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">WES credential evaluations do not expire.<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Applicants can log in to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">My Account<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and order a duplicate copy for any recipient such as an institution, employer, or licensing board. Copies are typically sent within one to two business days.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Prior to joining WES, I worked with ACT (American College Testing), so I often highlight the lifetime value of a credential evaluation by comparing it to the ACT\u2014a college entrance exam. One key difference is ACT scores are considered valid for three years. Once a student enrolls in college, the exam no longer serves a purpose. If a student transfers to another university, they do not submit their high school transcripts and test scores. Instead, it is their college transcript that determines their eligibility for admission.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A WES credential evaluation, however, provides a U.S. or Canadian equivalency for an academic credential earned in another country. Those results do not change over time. A credential evaluation will continue to support your school and job applications and r\u00e9sum\u00e9, providing context and validation to anyone reviewing your evaluation report, whether you are seeking further education, employment, licensing, or immigration.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Same report, new opportunities<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Applicants typically have a specific goal when they first receive their credential evaluation. When applying for an evaluation, many applicants believe that obtaining an evaluation is merely a required step toward their immediate goal, and that they will never use it again. But often this is not the case. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, an applicant uses their credential evaluation first for graduate school. They believe that once they are awarded a master\u2019s degree, no one will ever again ask for confirmation of their bachelor\u2019s degree. However, this isn\u2019t true. There is often a need to provide proof of all previously earned degrees when seeking further education or employment. Having access to your evaluation report ensures minimal delays as you\u2019re pursuing new opportunities and goals. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">WES is a partner and resource<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">WES advances global mobility and integration of people into academic and professional settings.
