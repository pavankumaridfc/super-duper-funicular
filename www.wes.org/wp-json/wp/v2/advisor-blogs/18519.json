The unprecedented move would have mostly impacted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/trump-immigration-tweet-millions-in-us-illegally-removed-starting-next-week-mass-immigration-arrests-conversations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mixed-status families and children<\/a> in 10 major cities, including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City.<\/p>\n<p>However, at the urging of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/06\/22\/politics\/nancy-pelosi-ice-raids-house-speaker-called-donald-trump\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trump called off his own plan last Friday<\/a>. Then, he stated that he will delay the ICE raids for two weeks in order to &#8220;give Democrats and Republicans a chance to work out a solution&#8221; to illegal immigration at the border.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Trump: Less Support Will Help Border Crisis<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Last week, Trump also announced that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-immigration-trump\/as-promised-trump-slashes-aid-to-central-america-over-migrants-idUSKCN1TI2C7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">millions of dollars in aid to Central American countries<\/a> will be cut. The move will specifically target El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, because thousands of their citizens had attempted to cross into the United States through Mexico. Trump\u2019s administration believes that eliminating much-needed resources from imperiled countries will demotivate people from fleeing those countries.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>OPT Processing Time Nearly Doubles<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>What used to be a standard 90-day processing time for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/2019\/06\/18\/h-1b-visa-amid-opt-work-permit-delays-foreign-students-reportedly-losing-internship-opportunities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optional Practical Training (OPT) work permits is now up to a five-month<\/a> wait time for international students and recent graduates. This puts work opportunities such as summer jobs and internships at risk of being lost while students remain in limbo. This has also created several <a href=\"https:\/\/splinternews.com\/trump-administrations-visa-delays-are-leaving-internati-1835584570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial roadblocks<\/a> for international students, especially when it comes to covering housing and transportation costs. Angered by this, many students have started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/06\/16\/us\/politics\/visas-international-students.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">petitions and written letters<\/a> to university leaders to voice their frustration.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Chinese-U.S. Tensions Impact Student Enrollment<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>A decline in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/stock-market-news\/trumps-trade-war-with-china-could-squeeze-us-colleges-next-1901262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chinese student enrollment<\/a> is being attributed to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. As a result, American colleges and universities report that visa delays and denials are taking a toll on international student enrollment. Because international students contribute <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2019-06\/15\/c_138144527.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over 42 billion annually to the U.S. economy<\/a>, the decline could have serious implications.

ACT and SAT test scores are no longer a requirement for admissions at Carthage College, Marquette University, the University of Rochester, and the University of Southern Maine.<\/p>\n<p>While policies vary by institution, this move could lead to increased enrollment applications, as seen at the University of Rochester.
