Other organizations, such as the Real Estate Council of British Columbia (REC BC) and the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (ICCRC), also accept the test for membership to their organizations. All four skill components of the CELPIP-General Test are delivered by computer at three-hour test sittings that are held at CELPIP Test Centres located across Canada, and in select cities internationally.<\/p>\n<p>The CELPIP-General LS Test has been approved by IRCC for use by individuals who are applying for Canadian citizenship.

The CELPIP Test is fully computer delivered, so ensure that you are comfortable with a mouse and keyboard. Practicing with CELPIP\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/secure.paragontesting.ca\/InstructionalProducts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free online sample test<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/secure.celpiptest.ca\/RegWebApp\/#\/account\/create-account\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free online practice test<\/a> are good ways to familiarize yourself with this format.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Remember that CELPIP is a test of general English proficiency<\/strong>. CELPIP assesses your ability to use English in everyday situations. It is not a test of business English or academic English. One of the best ways to prepare is just to get out and use English as much as possible in your daily life.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical structures<\/strong>. Try to show the range of your vocabulary in your writing and speaking. Avoid using the same words over and over again. You don\u2019t need to memorize the dictionary\u2014just use words that would be natural in daily life. Remember to use varied grammatical structures and construct sentences that differ in length and complexity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Manage your time<\/strong>. The CELPIP Test is fully computer delivered, and you will see a timer on each screen, telling you how much time you have left for that section. Keeping an eye on these timers can help you gauge how to pace yourself throughout the test.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check your work<\/strong>. If you have any time left over while completing the reading, listening, or writing components of the test, make sure to read over your answers and make sure that you have attempted to answer all questions as well as you can. In particular, try to spend a few minutes reviewing your writing, ensuring that you have no typos that could impact the clarity of your response.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Speak clearly and at a natural pace<\/strong>. Speak clearly into the microphone, which should be close to your lips but without touching them. It is natural to speak quickly when you are nervous\u2014try to slow down and speak at a normal pace.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Do not worry about your accent<\/strong>. Our raters are trained to disregard accents. Unless your accent prevents you from being understood, do not focus on it. Instead, concentrate on using good grammar, accurate and varied vocabulary, and providing complete answers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Take notes<\/strong>. While taking the CELPIP Test, you will be provided with notepaper and a pen. You may use these to take notes during any point in the test, though you may find it especially useful to outline some ideas for your speaking or writing responses. It is also a good idea to take notes about main ideas and specific details during the listening test.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Focus on what you know<\/strong>. You may come across some difficult words in a reading or listening passage. Do not get stuck worrying about words you do not understand. Focus on general meaning and the parts of the passage that you <em>do\u00a0<\/em>understand. Sometimes it is possible to understand a new word based on your knowledge of the words that are around it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use a variety of reading strategies<\/strong>. You do not have to read every single word in a passage to successfully answer questions on the reading test; instead, use reading strategies, such as skimming and scanning. These may help you with some of the simpler questions, leaving more time to spend with the more difficult questions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>Related Article<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/strengthen-your-english-skills\/\">8 Ways to Strengthen Your English Skills<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/prepare-ielts-test\/\">How to Prepare for the IELTS Test<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/best-practices-toefl-exam\/\">Best Practices for Taking the TOEFL Exam<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":10150,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135,200,152],"advisor_tags":[7],"better_featured_image":{"id":10150,"alt_text":"Student studying in library","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"3.5","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","caption":"Production Tool Ref #12","created_timestamp":"1428370564","copyright":"Steve Debenport","focal_length":"95","iso":"500","shutter_speed":"0.008","title":"African American male student studying late in library after hours","orientation":"1","keywords":["Computer","Male Beauty","Student","College Student","Coffee Cup","Female","Young Men","Male","Paperwork","Inspiration","Back to School","Youth Culture","Homework","Working Late","Young Adult","Reading","Looking","Studying","Intelligence","Learning","African Ethnicity","Planning","Preparation","Contemplation","Concentration","Happiness","Confidence","Loneliness","Solitude","American Culture","Ideas","Life Events","Education","Technology","Research","Lifestyles","Indoors","Horizontal","Cheerful","People","Library","School Building","University","Textbook","Book","Laptop","Exam","Coffee - Drink","Casual Clothing","Isptool15q1"]}},"post":10149,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/blog_20180208_iStock-469047760.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Chris Koelbleitner","author":{"ID":10146,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2018-02-06 13:40:57","post_date_gmt":"2018-02-06 18:40:57","post_content":"Chris Koelbleitner is a Manager of Instructional Products and Programs at Paragon Testing Enterprises.","post_title":"Chris Koelbleitner","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"chris-koelbleitner","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:11:09","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:11:09","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=10146","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"external_contributor":true},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>English Proficiency: Mastering the CELPIP Test - World Education Services<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (CELPIP) is a multi-purpose English test that allows test takers to demonstrate their ability to function in English.
