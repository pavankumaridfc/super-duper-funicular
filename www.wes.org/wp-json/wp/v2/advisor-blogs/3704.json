Professional boards and agencies generally require a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/about-wes-credential-evaluation\/\">credential evaluation<\/a>. A WES evaluation can help speed up the licensing\/certification process.<\/p>\n<p>Candidates should always check with the licensing\/certification board or agency to find out what type of credential evaluation is required. Most boards require a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/about-wes-credential-evaluation\/\">WES Course-by-Course evaluation<\/a>. Some boards also require official copies of your academic transcripts. This requirement can be accommodated by purchasing WES&#8217; International Credential Advantage Package (ICAP), which is a service WES provides where WES will store your verified transcripts and evaluation report for easy sending later.<\/p>\n<p>There are many elements you must consider and prepare for when it comes to professional licensure, so here are three resources to help you start in the right place:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearhq.org\/page-1720468\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The Council on Licensure, Enforcement, and Regulation (CLEAR)<\/strong><\/a><strong>: <\/strong>CLEAR is an official listing of associations and professional organizations related to licensing and certification. They also help with regulation and provide resources through webinars, conferences, services, and publications. It includes representatives from government, private, and other sectors interested in the licensure field.\u00a0CLEAR also provides a comprehensive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearhq.org\/page-481284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>directory of boards<\/strong><\/a> of professional and occupational licensure for North America, which is searchable by profession or jurisdiction (state or province).<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.credentialingexcellence.org\/nccadirectory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) Member Listing<\/strong><\/a><strong>: <\/strong>As part of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE), the NCCA sets quality standards for credentialing organizations. Their standards help ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the public and are applicable across professions and industries.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/farb.imiscloud.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Federation of Associations of Regulatory Boards (FARB)<\/strong><\/a><strong>: <\/strong>FARB is an organization that is made up of professional licensing boards. It is a non-profit aimed at promoting public protection and providing an effective exchange of information between associations of regulatory boards to help them cooperatively solve mutual regulatory issues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These resources are a great place to start when you are considering earning a license or certification in a certain profession. Also\u00a0be sure to look into the region you are interested in so you know the exact licensure requirements.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/get-started-with-wes-credential-evaluation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getting Started with Your WES Credential Evaluation<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":4383,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[214,200],"advisor_tags":[408],"better_featured_image":{"id":4383,"alt_text":"Professional Licensure, credential evaluation","caption":"Cropped shot of a young businesswoman looking at blueprints in her officehttps:\/\/195.154.178.81\/DATA\/i_collage\/pu\/shoots\/806325.jpg","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":424,"file":"2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"2.5","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"NIKON D800E","caption":"Cropped shot of a young businesswoman looking at blueprints in her officehttps:\/\/195.154.178.81\/DATA\/i_collage\/pu\/shoots\/806325.jpg","created_timestamp":"1455098044","copyright":"mapodile","focal_length":"50","iso":"250","shutter_speed":"0.00125","title":"Going over the plans","orientation":"1","keywords":["Beautiful","Real People","White Collar Worker","Creative Occupation","Businesswoman","One Woman Only","Only Women","One Young Woman Only","Young Women","Women","Females","Copy Space","Adults Only","Blueprint","Young Adult","Adult","Sitting","Looking","Working","Beauty","Ethnic","Ethnicity","Office Building","Plan","One Person","Success","Expertise","Strategy","Planning","Dedication","Creativity","Confidence","Part Of","Inside Of","Business","Indoors","Content","Brown Hair","Black Hair","Architect","Design Professional","Business Person","Office Worker","Professional Occupation","Occupation","People","Office","Place of Work","Design","Eyeglasses","Eyewear","Attractive Female","Smart Casual","Corporate Business","Entrepreneur"]}},"post":3704,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/blog_20170502_iStock_85657027.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Advisor","author":{"ID":3295,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_content":"WES Advisor is an initiative of World Education Services, a non-profit organization with over 45 years of experience in international education.
