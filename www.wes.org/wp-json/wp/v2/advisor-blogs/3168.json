Because F-1 visa holders can arrive as early as\u00a030 days in advance of their program, they are also given\u00a0the authorization to start working <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ice.gov\/sevis\/employment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on-campus<\/a> within that period.\u00a0For on-campus employment, you must comply with specific conditions which consist\u00a0mainly of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working in a student service related field<\/li>\n<li>Location of the job must be on-campus (up to 20-hours a week)<\/li>\n<li>Applying for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/pubs\/EN-05-10181.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Security Number (SSN)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ice.gov\/sevis\/employment#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Off-campus<\/a> employment is also an option but it is granted only\u00a0on the basis of extraordinary causes that directly affect the\u00a0student\u2019s ability to finance their program. Off-campus employment can start only if you are granted the option by your designated school official (normally\u00a0this is the person who signs your <a href=\"https:\/\/studyinthestates.dhs.gov\/what-is-the-form-i-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I-20 application<\/a>) and by filling out the corresponding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/i-765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I-765<\/a> form.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Optional Practical Training (OPT) &amp; Curricular Practical Training\u00a0(CPT)<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ice.gov\/sevis\/practical-training\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optional Practical Training (OPT)<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ice.gov\/sevis\/practical-training\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Curricular Practical Training (CPT)<\/a> statuses are given on the\u00a0basis of providing an international student with the option of professional training\u00a0before heading back to their country of origin. International students are eligible\u00a0for both once they have finished their first academic year. The main difference\u00a0between them are CPT is linked to a registered class, whereas OPT is not. OPT can be\u00a0granted pre- or post-graduation but the field of work which international students\u00a0will be allowed to practice has to be related to their major.<\/p>\n<p>However, off-campus and OPT statuses are basically the same and you can only be\u00a0granted one. That is the main reason why off-campus status is not common and only\u00a0suggested in extraordinary conditions.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>H-1B Visa<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Obtaining an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/h1b-lottery-cap-gap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">H-1B visa<\/a> is your last step if you are contemplating a professional career in the U.S. Through the H-1B visa program, you are able to work in the U.S. for up to three years with a renewal of an additional three years. Obtaining an H-1B visa can be challenging, particularly because there is a standard cap of 65,000 granted annually (you also need to be sponsored by your workplace). Fortunately, this cap does not apply to higher education institutions or nonprofit organizations looking to hire international professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1997 the number of H-1B visas granted greatly exceeds the cap (in fact, in\u00a0most years the number granted is more than twice the cap). In 2012, a total of 136,000\u00a0H-1B visas were granted and similar to student visas, they are also on the rise. It is\u00a0important to note that the H-1B visa program is on a \u201cfirst come, first\u00a0served\u201d basis.<\/p>\n<h4><b>In Conclusion<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>So what does this all mean for you? It means that as an international student, you\u00a0are given multiple options to expand the scope of your student experience. For example,\u00a0if you are interested in doing research, you can use the on-campus employment option to\u00a0get acquainted with the methodologies and research topics that your university offers\u00a0through its research centers. Or you can use the off-campus option to start building\u00a0your own network of professionals. Most universities host on-campus job fairs that you\u00a0can attend and use to connect with future employers. You can also use these\u00a0employment options to gain further insight into the strengths and limitations of your\u00a0program.<\/p>\n<p>Remember these employment options are designed to help you put into practice the\u00a0skills and knowledge you are learning in a professional environment. Ultimately, these\u00a0different employment options offer you the possibility to gain access to one of the\u00a0most competitive labor markets in the world.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>This website contains general information and does not constitute legal advice.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":5594,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135,152],"advisor_tags":[514,485,471],"better_featured_image":{"id":5594,"alt_text":"Visa application and passport","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"post":3168,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/blog_20140128-shutterstock_111455090.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Alejandro Ortiz","author":{"ID":3574,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 20:58:26","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 20:58:26","post_content":"Alejandro Ortiz is a Research Assistant at World Education Services.","post_title":"Alejandro Ortiz","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"alejandro-ortiz","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:26:30","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:26:30","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=3574","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) -
