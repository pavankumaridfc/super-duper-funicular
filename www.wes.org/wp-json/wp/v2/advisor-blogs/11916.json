Most employers use job postings to describe the specific skills and attributes they seek. However, if you want to stand out from other applicants,\u00a0 you should think past the job ad.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, if you are an internationally educated professional, you may need to submit a credential evaluation with your job application. This will help you quickly verify your overseas education and qualifications.<\/p>\n<p>In a recent article on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/how-to-market-your-international-education-to-employers\/?country=canada\">how to market your international education to employers<\/a>, we described the steps involved in advertising your international education, and why it is important for employers to understand your education before they can hire you. By learning how and why employers use credential evaluations, you can better meet their needs as a candidate.<\/p>\n<h4>The Screening Process<\/h4>\n<p>Employers typically describe the key requirements of\u2014and qualifications for\u2014an open position through a job posting. To appeal to employers, job applicants need to demonstrate how they meet a role\u2019s specific criteria and qualifications; you will typically share this information through your cover letter and r\u00e9sum\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>Many employers require that applications be submitted via the company website. They may include additional screening questions such as, \u201cAre you educated outside of Canada?\u201d This query may prompt others, such as, \u201cHave you had your credentials evaluated?\u201d If you check &#8220;yes,&#8221; they will then ask you to upload a copy of your credential evaluation report.<\/p>\n<p>A human resources department, hiring manager, or third-party organization contracted by the employer will carefully review all incoming applications. They will ensure that candidates meet the role\u2019s specific requirements. Then, employers will consider the applicants that most closely meet the qualifications. For example, if you fail to provide your credential evaluation, or if it shows that your level of education is not suitable for the position, you will not move on to the next round.<\/p>\n<h4>Meeting the Requirements of the Role<\/h4>\n<p>Meeting a role\u2019s minimum requirements is, for most employers, standard protocol and is sometimes even essential for public safety and quality assurance purposes. For example, the <a href=\"https:\/\/ttc.ca\/Jobs\/Transit_Operator_Recruitment\/Educational_Requirements.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toronto Transit Commission<\/a>, one of the City of Toronto\u2019s largest employers, requires applicants for transit operator positions to have a minimum education level of grade 12. For applicants educated outside of Canada, it accepts equivalency documents from three of the six credential evaluation organizations in Canada, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\">World Education Services<\/a>. Internationally educated candidates cannot move forward from the first round of screening without an evaluation that documents the Canadian equivalency of their education. Requiring this step helps to verify that applicants meet the minimum requirements of the role.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, in some major financial institutions in Canada, particularly in higher level roles and in positions that require a security clearance, requirements can be strict. Candidates must provide evidence that they meet the specific criteria in the job posting. If not, the employer does not move forward with their application.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding whether the skills and qualifications in a job posting are necessary (and not just assets) will provide insight, as well. This will help you determine whether you truly qualify for the role and will help you explain your candidacy. Required qualifications are must-haves for a position; qualifications advertised as assets are not. Make sure you know the difference and can meet at least the minimum qualifications before you move forward with your application.<\/p>\n<h4>Background Checks<\/h4>\n<p>Depending on the position offered and the employer\u2019s business needs, some employers conduct background checks.<\/p>\n<p>A background check can be used to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify a candidate\u2019s experience (through reference checks)<\/li>\n<li>Confirm that there is no criminal history (through a criminal record check)<\/li>\n<li>Understand an applicant\u2019s credit history (through a credit report)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But a background check does not verify your education. To do this, an employer might ask a job candidate for official transcripts, a copy of their diploma or degree, or a credential evaluation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/about-wes-credential-evaluation\/\">WES credential evaluations<\/a> verify a candidate&#8217;s international education by demonstrating its equivalency in Canada. One employer we spoke to uses credential evaluations to verify the accuracy of claims made on employment applications. Another uses credential evaluations to determine a new hire\u2019s level of employment and salary. As stated by a human resources representative we work with, \u201cWe leave it up to the experts to determine the Canadian equivalency and whether the credentials are from a recognized, accredited institution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Not all employers conduct background checks. However, when the risks of a position are great, background checks may be necessary. Examples of high-risk jobs include those involving finance, infrastructure, or the health and safety of the public.<\/p>\n<h4>Hiring Decisions<\/h4>\n<p>As stated above, employers also use credential evaluations to better understand an applicant&#8217;s international education. Without a credential evaluation, it can be challenging for hiring managers to assess your level of education and specializations.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are a teacher, a credential evaluation can help a school determine what subjects you are qualified to teach. The school can also determine what level you should teach and what salary you qualify for, based on past experience.<\/p>\n<p>Although having a credential evaluation is advantageous, it is up to you as a job candidate to highlight your skills, experiences, and qualifications that are most appropriate to the position. A credential evaluation helps employers understand your education, assess whether you qualify for the role, and ultimately decide if they want to hire you.<\/p>\n<h4>Your Next Steps<\/h4>\n<p>Continue to do industry research, and connect with employers to learn more about their business needs. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/informational-interview\/?country=canada\">Informational interviews<\/a> are a great way to gain insight into your field, understand job requirements, and more accurately target your applications to increase your chances of getting a job offer. Learn your field\u2019s requirements and the qualifications for your desired role. Then decide whether or not a credential evaluation will help you on your path to employment. Most likely, that answer will be yes.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/how-to-use-your-credential-evaluation\/\">How to Use Your Credential Evaluation<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/using-your-credential-evaluation-for-employment\/\">Using Your Credential Evaluation for Employment<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":11918,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[214,200],"advisor_tags":[7,75,435],"better_featured_image":{"id":11918,"alt_text":"credential evaluation for employment Canada","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20180724-istock-626468810-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20180724-istock-626468810-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20180724-istock-626468810-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20180724-istock-626468810-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20180724-istock-626468810-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20180724-istock-626468810-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20180724-istock-626468810-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":11916,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/blog_20180724-istock-626468810.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Jodi Tingling","author":{"ID":8843,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-09-18 14:10:15","post_date_gmt":"2017-09-18 14:10:15","post_content":"Jodi Tingling is a Program Manager at WES Global Talent Bridge Canada.","post_title":"Jodi Tingling","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"jodi-tingling","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:18:21","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:18:21","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=8843","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"external_contributor":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How a Credential Evaluation Can Help You Find Employment<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Learn how a credential evaluation helps employers understand your international education.
