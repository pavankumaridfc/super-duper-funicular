The test day staff have been trained to make your IELTS experience as comfortable as possible. Because the results are highly regarded by so many institutions and organizations, it needs to be very secure. There are many security protocols to follow which includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personnel have been specifically trained in facial feature recognition, so they will carefully examine your face with your identification photo.<\/li>\n<li>Finger scans will be taken at the entrance of the test room and will be matched each time you leave and return.<\/li>\n<li>Your photograph will be taken by IELTS test day personnel and it will be shown with your test report form to receiving organizations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The reason for such high-security measures is to maintain the validity and integrity of the test scores by ensuring against fraud and cheating. Images of the finger scans are not stored and photographs will be used only for the purpose of the IELTS test. You can be assured that the security procedures are in place for your benefit as they allow for test results to be highly regarded by the receiving organization.<\/p>\n<h4>What do I need to bring on test day?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>exact same<\/strong> valid ID you used to book the test\u2014your passport or permanent resident card<\/li>\n<li>Your confirmation email<\/li>\n<li>2 HB or #2 pencils<\/li>\n<li>Clear bottle of water with the label removed (optional)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>What items are not allowed into the test room?<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Any electronic device\u2014watch, calculator, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Your cell phone\u2014even if it is turned off!<\/li>\n<li>Additional pieces of paper<\/li>\n<li>Food<\/li>\n<li>Any item that is not on the approved list<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Am I allowed to leave the test area?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes.
