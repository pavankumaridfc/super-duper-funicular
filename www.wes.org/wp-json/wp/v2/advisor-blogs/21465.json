He then\u00a0<\/em><em>travelled to Toronto to study human resources management, hoping to find a job after graduation and permanently settle in Canada.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>In this blog post, Tunde explains how he went from being an international student to a successful professional in Canada.<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Sitting at my desk in downtown Toronto, I often think about how I got where I am today. I recall my former job at a sausage factory, where I spent eight hours a day on my feet. Back then, I also had a night job as a traffic controller, outside in the cold, because I wanted to work my way through school.<\/p>\n<p>That was the inauspicious beginning of my Canadian dream\u2014not exactly what I had imagined a few months earlier, when I excitedly picked up my student visa in Lagos.<\/p>\n<p>But it was part of a long journey that ultimately took me where I needed to be. Below, I will tell you my story, with the hope that you will find examples that guide your success in Canada.<\/p>\n<h4>First, I Pursued a College Degree in Canada<\/h4>\n<p>I decided to attend college in Canada in order to guarantee that I was making the strongest possible professional choices. My career in Nigeria was beginning to pick up, but I wanted to see what else was out there.<\/p>\n<p>I remember being thrilled by the prospect of studying abroad, but I also felt uncertain. I had made my travel plans on short notice, so I was not financially prepared to pay tuition fees. But I had been accepted to one of Ontario\u2019s best and fastest-growing colleges, and I was not going to turn down an opportunity to study in Canada.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/wesadvisor-eguide-canadian-colleges-and-universities.html\">E-Guide: Canadian Colleges and Universities<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I arrived in Toronto with only $2,000 CAD\u2014enough to get settled, but insufficient to cover my school fees. After attending my first week of lectures in January, I realized it was too hard for me to focus on school because of the weather\u2014which was extremely cold\u2014and the sudden culture change. Everything was strange and new to me. I needed time to get acclimated.<\/p>\n<p>In the second week, I went to the admissions office and requested that my enrollment be deferred for four months. I explained to the admissions officer that I was experiencing culture shock. It was necessary for me to understand the system and the people. I needed a life outside of school, without being under a lot of pressure. Additionally, I wanted the opportunity to save money to pay the remainder of my tuition fees.<\/p>\n<h4>Next, I Had to Find Work<\/h4>\n<p>That same week, I registered with an employment agency. Soon, a potential employer called me for an interview.<\/p>\n<p>I thought that it would be easy to find a job, thanks to my human resources experience and bachelor\u2019s degree from Nigeria. The reality, however, was different. I was told I would not find a job in my field without a diploma and professional designation from Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, I got the job at the sausage factory.<\/p>\n<p>On my first day at the factory, I asked myself if I had made the right decision to move to Canada. In fact, my previous role in Nigeria was probably still available. However, despite my doubts, I believed that if I persevered I would overcome the challenges of settling in a new country.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-21565\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/wes-advisor-blog-2019-12-quote-v1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"635\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/wes-advisor-blog-2019-12-quote-v1.png 635w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/wes-advisor-blog-2019-12-quote-v1-300x111.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, I made friends at the factory who showed me around the city, giving me hope that I could learn more about Canada.<\/p>\n<p>With the money I earned at my first job, I was able to cover a good portion of my school fees. I was also gradually adapting to my new culture.<\/p>\n<p>Four months later, I resumed school and felt much more comfortable. That was when I took my second job as a traffic controller. On weekends, I cleaned robots at a Toyota manufacturing plant in Cambridge, Ontario. My earnings helped cover part of my second semester tuition fees.<\/p>\n<p>My spirit was tired, but not broken. I had a goal, and that was where I kept my focus.<\/p>\n<h4>Then, It Was Time to Move Forward<\/h4>\n<p>Because of my good grades and my human resources experience back home, I got an internship at a large insurance company called the Co-operators. They offered an opportunity to work at their company headquarters in Guelph. This is how my professional career path in Canada truly got started.<\/p>\n<p>In my day-to-day work, I made every effort to add value. My skills and competencies were fully utilized, and I soon started working toward a Certified Human Resources Professional (CHRP) designation. Although I had earned enough to nearly pay off my college fees in full, I kept my weekend cleaning job. I wore a shirt and tie on weekdays during my internship, and cleaned with a mop on weekends at Toyota.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of my internship, I was able to pay off all my tuition fees. I passed the CHRP exam and became a certified HR professional in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>By then, I had a postgraduate work permit that allowed me to work. Because I had shown excellent work ethic throughout my internship, I was offered a full-time position with the Co-operators.<\/p>\n<h4>Finally, I Obtained Permanent Residency<\/h4>\n<p>About a year after I began working full-time, I applied for (and received) permanent residency (PR) in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>World Education Services (WES) has a great process for reviewing academic documents and providing an international credential assessment. After receiving my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/evaluations-and-fees\/education\/first-year-admissions\/\">credential evaluation report<\/a> from WES, I was able to state on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that my Nigerian degree is equivalent to a Canadian bachelor\u2019s degree. This gave me the confidence to start thinking about what my next steps should be in my career.<\/p>\n<p>I always wanted to work in Toronto. Eventually the right opportunity came up: a higher role with more responsibility and a bigger portfolio. Today, I am employed at one of Canada\u2019s &#8220;Big Five&#8221; banks as a Senior Business Operations Analyst working in Technology Operations.<\/p>\n<h4>Where I Am Today, and How I Give Back<\/h4>\n<p>Getting up in the morning and heading to my office job in Toronto, I sometimes think about the days at the sausage factory and the nights I worked as a traffic controller. I cannot help but smile.<\/p>\n<p>I began to post on Twitter that I was available to help other immigrants and newcomers navigate their journey. Additionally, I do this work on a &#8220;pro bono&#8221; basis (which means I do not accept payment for my assistance).<\/p>\n<p>Today, I help newcomers by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reviewing their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s<\/li>\n<li>Providing suggestions on how to prepare for interviews<\/li>\n<li>Advising them on career pathways<\/li>\n<li>Telling them about valuable resources to help navigate the Canadian labour market<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I am happy that so many immigrants have shared their success stories with me, and I hope to continue helping as many as I can.<\/p>\n<h4>My Final Tips for Newcomers<\/h4>\n<p>Here is my advice for international students and professionals immigrating to Canada:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sort out your school fees first before immigrating.<\/li>\n<li>Arrive a month or two in advance to give yourself time to adjust.<\/li>\n<li>Do research on certifications and licences related to your field, since regulated professions might be different in your home country than they are in Canada.<\/li>\n<li>Take the initiative to meet people in your industry, so you can learn about job opportunities and developments in your field.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I know from personal experience that migrating to a new country is not always as easy as we think it will be. But I wish you all the best and I believe that you, too, can also succeed in Canada.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/100-tips-for-immigrants\/\">100 Tips for Immigrants<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/immigrants-canadian-job-market\/\">Are Immigrants Succeeding in Canada&#8217;s Job Market?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":21466,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[200,152],"advisor_tags":[7,807,435],"better_featured_image":{"id":21466,"alt_text":"journey to canada","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2019\/12\/blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"post":21465,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/blog_20191203_tunde-omotoye.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Tunde Omotoye","author":{"ID":21288,"post_author":"86","post_date":"2019-11-27 13:15:50","post_date_gmt":"2019-11-27 18:15:50","post_content":"Tunde Omotoye is a Senior Business Operations Analyst at BMO Financial Group.
