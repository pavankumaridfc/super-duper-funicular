We\u2019ve rounded up some of the most important information you\u2019ll need in order to take your next steps and obtain your credential evaluation report.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Related Reading<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/answers-top-10-frequently-asked-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top FAQs from 2020<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4><b>Advice for Getting an Evaluation in 2021<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing you should know is that we have stayed open for business throughout the pandemic. Therefore, all of our applicants have been able to continue moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WES did face some challenges; in response, we innovated solutions that would make it even faster and easier to receive a credential evaluation. We are glad that applicants will continue to benefit from those solutions for years to come.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are five updates that you should start taking advantage of right away:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h5><strong>1. WES Processing Times and How to Track Mail<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question that applicants ask most frequently is: How long does it take to get a credential evaluation from WES?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That answer actually depends on what type of report you ordered and if you are heading to Canada or the U.S. For an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/eca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Educational Credential Assessment (ECA)<\/a>, it takes about 35 days to complete your report (once we have received all of your required documents and your payment in full). For all other credential evaluation reports, that average period is 7 days.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best thing you can do to expedite your report is carefully review your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Required Documents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and ensure that WES receives them as quickly as possible. You can also encourage your school to send us your documents digitally (learn more about that below).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend that you use the tracking number provided by your courier service to see when your documents arrive at WES. From there, we will process and scan your documents. Once they are successfully processed, you will receive an update in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Account<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, you can find the latest updates about processing times (and other important announcements) on the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/important-wes-notices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notifications Page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h5><strong>2. Electronic File Transfers Can Expedite Your Report<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WES helped institutions around the world conquer one of their greatest difficulties during the pandemic by facilitating <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/send-electronic-academic-records\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">secure electronic file transfers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Today, we partner with thousands of institutions to receive documents electronically, which allows us start evaluating them sooner. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Required Documents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn about whether your school is already capable of sending your documents to us digitally.

You Can Upload Files to My Account<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of mailing a physical copy, you can upload translations and degree certificates directly to My Account. That means we\u2019ll receive and process your documents faster, without any shipping delays. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, review your <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Required Documents<\/a> and ensure that your institution sends all other document types (such as mark sheets, transcripts, and exam results) directly to WES. Applicants cannot mail their own documents to WES. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/send-documents-sealed-envelope\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn more here<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember: We need <em>all<\/em> of your required documents to start your evaluation. Therefore, uploading some of your documents directly can help reduce your overall wait.

It\u2019s Easier Than Ever to Apply for Your ECA<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know that most applicants only need to share their highest earned credential in order to get an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) from WES? For example, if you are immigrating to Canada and you have a postsecondary degree from another country, you likely do not need to send transcripts or files from your secondary studies. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/requirements-canada-educational-credential-assessment-eca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about it here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h5><strong>5.
