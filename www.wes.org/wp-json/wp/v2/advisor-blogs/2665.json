As a follow-up to our popular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/3-year-indian-bachelors-degree\/\">How U.S. Universities Evaluate Your 3-Year Indian Bachelor\u2019s Degree<\/a> post, we created this article to answer commonly asked questions from our readers.<\/p>\n<p>Below, find the answers to commonly asked questions about Indian degrees and credential evaluations.<\/p>\n<h4>What Is a Credential Evaluation?<\/h4>\n<p>Credential evaluation is a process that lets you know what the academic credentials from one country are worth in another country. The WES credential evaluation process includes the authentication of an applicant\u2019s academic documents to ensure they are valid. Then, WES creates a credential evaluation report that identifies and describes the applicant\u2019s credentials. It also provides their equivalency in terms of the U.S. or Canadian education system.<\/p>\n<p>A credential evaluation report helps institutions and employers\u00a0 understand your international education and background. Furthermore, WES credential evaluations are trusted because they credible authentication for international degrees. For this reason, WES is a leader in the field of credential evaluation.<\/p>\n<h4>Who Needs a Credential Evaluation?<\/h4>\n<p>You may need a credential evaluation if you earned all or part of your education outside of Canada or the U.S. A credential evaluation gives validity to your international education. You can use a credential evaluation report in multiple areas of your life. For example, it will come in handy for school and job applications, professional licensing, volunteer positions, immigration, and more.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/how-to-use-your-credential-evaluation\/\">How to Use Your Credential Evaluation for Employment, Education, and Professional Licensure<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Which Indian Schools Are Considered Accredited by U.S. Universities?<\/h4>\n<p>It depends on the universities you apply to; each institution has different standards for admission. Contact schools directly to find out if they have specific admission requirements for those with degrees from India.<\/p>\n<p>Many universities in North America require a credential evaluation if you studied in India.<\/p>\n<p>Here is how WES looks at Indian degrees:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Each application is reviewed individually:\u00a0<\/strong>WES refers to official authorities in India, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ugc.ac.in\/\">University Grants Commission<\/a> (UGC), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aicte-india.org\/\">All India Council for Technical Education<\/a> (AICTE), the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mhrd.gov.in\/\">Ministry of Human Resource Development<\/a> (MHRD), and other government entities as sources for accreditation. Because each application reflects a unique educational background, there are often exceptions and additional factors to consider in an individual&#8217;s application during the evaluation process.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Some degrees are considered equivalent to a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree:\u00a0<\/strong>Selected three-year Indian bachelor\u2019s degrees may be considered equivalent to a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree as long as they were earned in Division I, and the awarding institution is\u00a0currently accredited by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naac.gov.in\/\">India\u2019s National Assessment and Accreditation Council<\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.naac.gov.in\/\">(NAAC)<\/a> with a letter grade of \u201cA\u201d or better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Which Documents Do I Need for a Credential Evaluation?<\/h4>\n<p>It is very important to carefully read the <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\">required documents<\/a> list.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your level of education and which institution(s) you earned your degree from, you may need the following documents:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>University education:\u00a0<\/strong>Final or provisional degree certificate (for example, a bachelor&#8217;s degree, master\u2019s degree, doctorate degree, or postgraduate diploma) and statement of marks<\/li>\n<li><strong>State boards for technical\u00a0education:\u00a0<\/strong>Final or provisional diploma certificate and statement of marks<\/li>\n<li><strong>State boards for general nursing and\u00a0midwifery:\u00a0<\/strong>Certificate of General Nursing and Midwifery, annual statement of marks from the nursing board, and academic transcript from the nursing school or training hospital<\/li>\n<li><strong>Professional education (Institute of Chartered\u00a0Accountants, Institute of Cost and Work Accountants, Institution of Engineers,\u00a0Institute of Company Secretaries):\u00a0<\/strong>Certificate of Membership and statement of marks\/official examination results<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please note that the university or college that awarded your degree must send your statement of marks to WES.<\/p>\n<h4>How Do I Send My Documents to WES?<\/h4>\n<p>Carefully read WES\u2019 document requirements, and follow the instructions on how to submit your documents.<\/p>\n<p>Your institution can directly mail or electronically submit your required documents to WES. To <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/send-electronic-academic-records\/\">send documents electronically<\/a>, your institution must have a digital partnership with WES. If your institution does not already have this partnership in place, but you would like them to initiate one in order to expedite the transfer of your academic documents, please encourage them <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/contact-us\/\">Contact Us<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As of August 2021, India-educated applicants can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/send-documents-sealed-envelope\/\">send a sealed envelope<\/a> directly to WES.<\/p>\n<p>When communicating with WES, or sending any type of correspondence, be sure to include your WES Reference Number.<\/p>\n<h4>What Are Some Pathway Programs for Indian Students?<\/h4>\n<p>In many instances, Indian degree holders will discover that their education is only equivalent to three years of undergraduate study in the U.S. However, do not let this worry you because Indian degree holders can take advantage of pathway and training programs at community colleges and universities to help bridge any educational gaps.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community colleges: <\/strong>Enrolling in a community college is one of the best ways for students without enough credentials to earn their degree and have access to higher education. Additionally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/how-to-transition-from-an-associate-to-a-bachelors-degree\/\">community college<\/a> can provide a way for internationally educated students to familiarize themselves with a new education system.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Universities:\u00a0<\/strong>Some universities provide their own pathway programs for international students. To start, research your favorite universities to see which ones provide pathway programs for international students.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Training programs:\u00a0<\/strong> If you need specific skills to succeed in the U.S., there might be training programs available. These programs help internationally trained professionals and students achieve licenses and obtain new skills. To get your Indian education the recognition it deserves, do your research. It is important to find out about the exact expectations of a potential university or employer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\">Apply for a credential evaluation today<\/a> if you want to know how\u00a0your credentials translate to the U.S. education system.<\/p>\n<p>Think ahead about your educational and professional goals. You should begin the application process as early as possible. That will give you enough time to see if you need additional credentials before arriving in the U.S.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Ready to order a credential evaluation? <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\">Apply now<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":3731,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[389,466],"better_featured_image":{"id":3731,"alt_text":"Indian Degree","caption":"Three Indian students interested while reading information on a wall.","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"1.4","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","caption":"Three Indian students interested while reading information on a wall.","created_timestamp":"1455793174","copyright":"helenecanada","focal_length":"50","iso":"1250","shutter_speed":"0.005","title":"Indian students","orientation":"1","keywords":["Indian Ethnicity","Beautiful","Real People","Student","Building Exterior","School","Women","Men","Three People","Small Group Of People","Frame","20-24 Years","Young Adult","Smiling","Pointing","Reading","Looking","Learning","Indian Culture","Determination","Communication","Concentration","Curiosity","Education","Horizontal","People","India","Day","Corridor","Wall - Building Feature","School Building","University","Built Structure","Data"]}},"post":2665,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170131_iStock-510806258.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Advisor","author":{"ID":3295,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_content":"WES Advisor is an initiative of World Education Services, a non-profit organization with over 45 years of experience in international education.
