(Just don&#8217;t be an early bird: If your application arrives before April 1, your file might be returned.)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>In mid-April, t<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>he computer-generated lottery process begins.<\/strong> Approved petitions\u201365,000 for the general category and 20,000 for the advanced-degree exemption\u2013are selected at random. The lottery starts with applicants of all degree levels. After a first-round lottery, the remaining advanced-degree beneficiaries enter a second-round lottery. According to USCIS, applicants who hold advanced degrees issued in the U.S. can increase their chances 16 percent by applying to both the general and advanced lotteries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>By May 20, USCIS will reply to H-1B petitioners who applied for &#8220;premium processing.&#8221;<\/strong> Premium processing applicants pay a fee of $1,410 USD, but are guaranteed a decision on their applications within 15 days (or else they receive a refund). Using the premium processing service does <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> increase your chances of being selected in the lottery. <\/span>If you did not use the premium processing service, your check status can hint at your lottery result. USCIS starts cashing checks from lottery designees as early as May 11. If they have not cashed your check by the end of May, you probably did not get the lucky draw. You can track your application status by <a href=\"https:\/\/egov.uscis.gov\/casestatus\/landing.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">logging into the USCIS website<\/a> and inputting your 13-character receipt number.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Beginning in June, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/news\/news-releases\/uscis-announces-fy-2020-h-1b-cap-season-start-updates-and-changes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">standard applications are processed<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>. <\/strong>The government reveals most petition results between June and September. Keep in touch with your human resources staff or attorney while awaiting the results. USCIS might request further documentation from you or your employer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Approved H-1B visas take effect automatically on October 1.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>USCIS has made several recent changes to the H-1B petition process, including the implementation of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/working-united-states\/temporary-workers\/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models\/h-1b-fiscal-year-fy-2020-cap-season\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two-phase premium processing system<\/a>.

Remember to bring a copy of your H-1B lottery documents with you, including your receipt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if your H-1B petition is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chosen, your OPT will end immediately. USCIS will offer you a 60-day grace period, after which time you must leave the U.S. During the grace period, students can not work. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>What Is an RFE?<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RFE is an abbreviation for \u201cRequest for Evidence.\u201d If you receive an RFE, it means that USCIS needs additional materials from you in order to determine whether to approve your H-1B application. An RFE is not an indication that your H-1B application will ultimately be denied, but it does suggest that your application is missing important information. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you receive a USCIS RFE, do not be discouraged. Read the RFE carefully, follow the instructions, and provide the requested documents. Given the complexity of RFEs, we recommend consulting with your human resources managers and immigration attorney to make sure the request is handled properly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The H-1B lottery process is stressful and complicated\u2013unfortunately, that is a fact for everyone. But remember: 85,000 international students win the lottery every year. That is quite a few! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best of luck to all of the students who will be applying for H-1B petitions this year!<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/h-1b-requirements-and-updates\/\">H-1B Regulatory Requirements and Updates<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/understanding-visas-to-study-and-work\/\">Understanding Visas to Study and Work in the U.S.<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":16069,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[152],"advisor_tags":[797,397,435,5,471],"better_featured_image":{"id":16069,"alt_text":"h1b lottery","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2019\/03\/20190322_iStock-134061666_high.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"20190322_iStock-134061666_high-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/20190322_iStock-134061666_high-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"20190322_iStock-134061666_high-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/20190322_iStock-134061666_high-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"20190322_iStock-134061666_high-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/20190322_iStock-134061666_high-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"20190322_iStock-134061666_high-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/20190322_iStock-134061666_high-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"20190322_iStock-134061666_high-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/20190322_iStock-134061666_high-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"shakzu","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":16026,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/20190322_iStock-134061666_high.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Xiao Lu","author":{"ID":3448,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 18:16:57","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 18:16:57","post_content":"Xiao Lu is a Marketing Associate\u00a0at World Education Services.","post_title":"Xiao Lu","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"xiao-lu","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:35:17","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:35:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=3448","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"external_contributor":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How to Prepare for the 2020 H-1B Lottery and Cap Gap<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The H-1B visa filing period opens April 1.
