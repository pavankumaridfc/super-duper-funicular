That is because you have to pass an English exam to immigrate via Express Entry.<\/p>\n<p>But did you know that mastering French can also help you qualify for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/express-entry-canada-ielts\/\">Express Entry<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>French is one of the nation&#8217;s two official languages, but it is less common. Therefore, although you must be proficient in English, you will earn bonus points if you also know French.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, Canadian employers might prefer to hire someone who speaks French. Securing employment is helpful, because work experience also counts toward Express Entry.<\/p>\n<p>To improve your language skills, you can choose to attend a college or university where the courses are taught in French. Immersion programs allow you to practice your French while pursuing an unrelated major. Graduating from a French immersion program could help you stand out when applying for jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Below, learn more about the advantages of speaking French as an international newcomer in Canada.\u00a0You will also find an overview of colleges and universities that offer programs in French.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/wesadvisor-eguide-canadian-colleges-and-universities.html\">Canadian Colleges and Universities: A Guide to Canada\u2019s Higher Education System<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>The Advantages of Speaking French for Canadian Immigrants<\/h4>\n<p>As either a primary or secondary language, it is valuable for Canadian residents to know French. You can become fluent by enrolling in either a fully immersive (all-French) or bilingual (French-English) program. These are offered across several provinces, so you will be able to choose the environment, location, and program type that sounds right to you.<\/p>\n<p>Here are two of the ways that French can contribute to your successful immigration journey:<\/p>\n<h4>Gain Work Experience in Canada<\/h4>\n<p>After graduating from a post-secondary degree program, you can earn points toward Express Entry by gaining work experience in Canada. (This falls under the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/eligibility\/canadian-experience-class.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canadian Experience Class<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Just remember, you must first obtain a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/study-canada\/work\/after-graduation\/about.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post-graduation work permit<\/a>. Then, be sure to promote your French-language skills on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and in your cover letter when applying for jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Many employers seek skilled immigrants who can speak French. Improve your chances of landing a job by using your time at school to work on your French.<\/p>\n<h4>Qualify for the Provincial Nominee Program<\/h4>\n<p>In addition to Express Entry, immigrant hopefuls can look into the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/provincial-nominees\/works.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Provincial Nominee Program<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This program allows the provinces and territories to nominate individuals for immigration to Canada. If you have attended school in a certain province, participated in the local community, found work in the area (or shown value as a future employee), and demonstrated cultural interest\u2014such as learning French\u2014it might improve your chances of earning this special nomination.<\/p>\n<p>The Provincial Nominee Program does, however, presume that you will settle in that particular area once you have received your visa. If this is your aim, it is important to choose where you study and work carefully. Be sure it is somewhere you could see yourself living for many years.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Learn More: Read the E-Guide<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/wesadvisor-eguide-professional-development-strategies.html\">Professional Development Strategies: Your Career Success in North America<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>French Universities and Colleges in Canada<\/h4>\n<p>French immersion programs can improve your chances of immigrating after graduation.<\/p>\n<p>If French is your native language, or your skills are very advanced, you might want to choose a complete immersion program. If French is a secondary language, or one you are still working on, another option is to attend a bilingual program.<\/p>\n<p>Although not exhaustive, the list below demonstrates the kinds of French-language programs that you can find across Canada\u2014organized by province.<\/p>\n<h4>British Columbia<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/baff-offa\/fr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simon Fraser University<\/a> is located in scenic Burnaby, British Columbia. Students can study in French (or English) within the school of Arts and Social Sciences and the school of Education. At Simon Fraser, international students make up about 19 percent of the student population. Many of those who participate in French programs further their language development skills by taking advantage of the school\u2019s partnerships and studying abroad in Europe and Quebec.<\/p>\n<h4>Manitoba<\/h4>\n<p>In Winnipeg, Manitoba, <a href=\"https:\/\/ustboniface.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Sainte-Boniface<\/a> is the only fully immersive French-language university in the province and is located in the French Quarter.

Both offer a variety of programs. La Cit\u00e9 has a second campus in Ottawa.<\/p>\n<p>In the nation\u2019s capital, you will also find the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uottawa.ca\/fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University of Ottawa<\/a>. At this prestigious institution, you can study in French, English, or both.<\/p>\n<h4>New Brunswick<\/h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.umoncton.ca\/english\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">University of Moncton<\/a> is the largest French-language institution in Canada, outside of Quebec. Situated in New Brunswick, one of Canada\u2019s Atlantic provinces, the university offers more than 160 programs of study. They include law, nursing, science, and social work.

Its programs of study include arts and culture, natural sciences, and community services.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Your Questions Answered<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/how-to-apply-to-canadian-universities-and-colleges\/\">How to Apply to Canadian Colleges and Universities<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Preparing for Your Immigration Journey<\/h4>\n<p>Whether you want to join a French-language program at a large university or cozy college, in a big city or small town, you have plenty of options to choose from in Canada.

Research Canada\u2019s immigration processes and policies carefully, so that you can take advantage of every opportunity and be prepared in case of potential setbacks. Be sure that you thoroughly understand your options before planning your education and post-graduate journey.<\/p>\n<p>It is a good idea to start this research early. However, it is undeniable that reading, writing, and speaking French will be a valuable asset along the way.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Next Steps: Watch the Webinar<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/wes-archive-the-canadian-higher-education-system-putting-your-education-to-work.html\">The Canadian Higher Education System: Putting Your Education to Work<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":16607,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[7,351,397,352],"better_featured_image":{"id":16607,"alt_text":"french universities Canada","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2019\/04\/iStock-491139885-e1555097691501.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/iStock-491139885-e1555097691501-541x362.jpg"},"medium_large":{"file":"iStock-491139885-768x512.jpg","width":768,"height":512,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/iStock-491139885-768x512.jpg"},"large":{"file":"iStock-491139885-1024x683.jpg","width":1024,"height":683,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/iStock-491139885-1024x683.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"2.8","credit":"Getty Images\/iStockphoto","camera":"Canon EOS-1D X","caption":"Young Indian business woman with crossed arms in front of a building.
