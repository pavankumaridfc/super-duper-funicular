She was born in New York, then moved to Iraq at age 6.<\/p>\n<p>Sulaf earned her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science. She went on to give lectures and train students. But Sulaf\u2019s career came to an abrupt halt with the outbreak of the Iraq War.<\/p>\n<p>She and her family were forced to flee to Jordan. There, she had to look for creative ways to apply her skills in order to rebuild her career.<\/p>\n<p>Now, she is an advocate for &#8220;transferable skills.&#8221; Those are flexible career skills you can take with you from job to job, or country to country. Read her story below.<\/p>\n<h4>Adapting in the Face of Adversity<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cAt first, when you leave, you don\u2019t very much have a plan, you just have to figure out the next step,\u201d Sulaf says. Most Iraqis had gone to neighboring countries to wait for things to cool down.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOur situation was supposed to be temporary. But then it took longer and longer, and everything in the host country got crowded. No further work permits were issued. You realize you don\u2019t want to stay in limbo, so you try to find the next best step.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In Jordan, where the influx of people fleeing the war led to greater competition for jobs, Sulaf looked for a creative way to use her skills and background in information technology. She started teaching in a computer center and within six months she became manager. But Sulaf wanted to do something that challenged and interested her more.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019m the type who likes to take different classes and learn new things, so I took courses here and there to satisfy my love of learning. Maybe it would have been better if I had been planning the exact way forward, but I don\u2019t always do that. It\u2019s more of always being open and flexible about embracing new possibilities, rather than sticking to one track.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Personal Networking<\/h4>\n<p>Thanks to a network of acquaintances who had also relocated to Jordan, Sulaf was able to explore other employment options. A friend told her about a free course on stock market consulting that could lead to a job opportunity. Sulaf\u2019s outstanding performance and previous teaching experience made her a great candidate. She got a position training people to manage their stocks on an online platform. But part of this role involved the painful experience of witnessing how her clients, including refugees and immigrants seeking a source of income, traded and lost their savings, and she needed to move on.<\/p>\n<p>A friend from college connected Sulaf with a former professor who offered her a job in project management at a multinational company. By then, Sulaf had started a second master\u2019s degree\u2014this one in business administration\u2014with an eye on courses that would teach her the skills needed to pursue a wider range of careers in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn this case, mine is not a typical immigrant story because I moved with a huge chunk of the society I knew. But increasingly, renewing residency permits and visas became complicated in Jordan. Since my brother and I were born in the U.S., it made sense to try and move there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sulaf and her family made the decision to establish themselves in the U.S., and Sulaf prepared to continue her professional career in New York. Her school in Iraq taught computer science programs in English, a language she already knew. So she had an advantage moving to an English-speaking country.<\/p>\n<h4>Relocating to Move Forward<\/h4>\n<p>When Sulaf started her MBA studies in Jordan, she took the precaution of choosing classes that would be more useful abroad\u2014in case she didn\u2019t finish the degree. Indeed, she left for New York before completing her studies. For her first six months in the U.S., she worked on completing projects she had started in Jordan. Working for a multinational firm with sister companies in the U.S. allowed her to change countries without changing jobs.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, however, with the move to a new country, Sulaf lost most of her network and connections. She decided to do volunteer work translating online publications as a way to make the most of her language proficiency and stay active in her new environment while planning her next steps. \u201cYou need to find an organization that helps you reconnect,\u201d she suggests.<\/p>\n<p>Nine months after her arrival, a cousin told her about a job readiness program at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwardlyglobal.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Upwardly Global<\/a>. \u201cUpwardly Global counselors used their network to help mentees. They helped us with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and mock interviews.\u201d Through Upwardly Global, Sulaf landed a job at WES. In the past nine years, she achieved two promotions (to manager and advanced evaluation specialist).<\/p>\n<h4>Marketing Transferable Skills<\/h4>\n<p>Transferable skills are the skills that go with you from one job to the next\u2014or one country to the next. There can be many professional integration barriers beyond your control. For example, employers might not recognize your degree from abroad. Or, you might have to meet regulatory requirements for licensing and re-credentialing. But you can chance your circumstances by identifying, enhancing, and expanding portable skills and competencies.<\/p>\n<p>Of transferable skills, Sulaf notes, \u201cIn other countries that term is not very well known. You instinctively know your skills are transferable, but you don\u2019t know of or use that term\u2026I also wasn\u2019t really strategizing how to use my transferable skills. Instead, my attitude was more, \u2018Let me see what\u2019s out there and if it fits me, then I\u2019m applying. If the job requirements are things I know I can do, then I\u2019m going to apply.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Each new experience brought Sulaf new opportunities to develop and hone different skills. She was a good fit for WES because of her proficiency in Arabic and professional experience in Middle Eastern countries, but she knew she would have to learn about topics that were new to her, such as international education systems and credential evaluations. As she did in Jordan, Sulaf set out to acquire knowledge based on her interests and abilities, as well as on the professional requirements of the job.<\/p>\n<p>As she expanded her skill set, Sulaf excelled at emphasizing the skills that would be useful in different professional settings. Then, it easy for her to explore a variety of pathways. Sulaf used informational interviews and other job search strategies to learn about career options.<\/p>\n<h5>Here is some information about Sulaf&#8217;s job search strategies:<\/h5>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <strong>informational interview <\/strong>is a conversation with someone in a role or organization you want to find out more about. You ask questions to learn more precisely what the position is like\u2014as well as specific responsibilities and other aspects of working in the field. According to Sulaf, informational interviews can be helpful \u201cbecause you learn if a job is exactly what you thought it was going to be, from someone who is in that same position.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Networking<\/strong> is another way to ease your transition to a new career. She notes, \u201cNetworking events were helpful because you could build local connections. I always tried to add local people to my LinkedIn contacts, so I could grow my network and find people in the field that I need to connect with under targeted themes.\u201d<\/li>\n<li><strong>Volunteering<\/strong> has also helped Sulaf manage the many transitions in her life. Many experts recommend volunteering as a way to create a network and develop new skills. Sulaf not only volunteered as a translator during her initial years in New York, she also continually seeks out volunteer opportunities within her current organization. \u201cI get more involved with different teams at work and participate whenever possible. Stay curious, because there\u2019s always an opportunity to get involved. If you\u2019re lucky to have people who help you along the way, you\u2019ll be more willing to help those who come after you.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>The Power of Change<\/h4>\n<p>Ultimately, in spite of the many twists and turns in her career, making many professional changes has been a positive experience for Sulaf.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe end result is I have more confidence. I know that if I ever need to change again, I will be able to recreate myself. Once you\u2019ve done it a few times, you become more sure of yourself,\u201d she says.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s always that part, when you grow up somewhere else and your life has a different path than you expected, where you miss aspects of what you left. At the same time, after years [have] passed by and you have re-established your life and your connections, your view changes and you embrace your new life. It\u2019s always difficult at the beginning to accept leaving your life behind and starting over. Life keeps changing, so I try not to get stuck pursuing just one goal. I continue to grow and learn things that interest me in various fields. The more skills and experiences you have, the wider the range of pathways you can pursue.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/wesadvisor-eguide-professional-development-strategies.html\">E-Guide: Professional Development Strategies<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/accounting-e-guide-u-s\/\">Accounting E-Guide: Career Pathways for International Accountants in the U.S.<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":18385,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[200],"advisor_tags":[75,407,446,435,5],"better_featured_image":{"id":18385,"alt_text":"transferable skills jobs","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2019\/06\/blog_20190618_iStock-507631072.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/blog_20190618_iStock-507631072-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"undrey","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":18381,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/blog_20190618_iStock-507631072.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Global Talent Bridge","author":{"ID":3405,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 16:04:07","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 16:04:07","post_content":"WES Global Talent Bridge is a program dedicated to helping skilled immigrants fully utilize their talents and education in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/partners\/global-talent-bridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United States<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/partners\/global-talent-bridge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canada<\/a>.
