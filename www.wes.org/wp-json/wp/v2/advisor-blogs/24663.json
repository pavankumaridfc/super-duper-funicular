Convert your file to JPEG or PDF format and retry your upload.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Size<\/strong>: You may receive an error indicating that the file you uploaded exceeds the 10 MB size limit. In this case, you need to re-save your file to reduce the file size and re-upload.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Image quality<\/strong>: All files must be clear and legible. If the file you uploaded does not meet our image quality standards, you\u2019ll need to get a clearer image of your document and retry your upload. If you cannot see a preview of your file, you can try uploading it again. However, unless you receive an error message, then your file has not encountered any known errors on our end, and you can proceed to send it through without previewing it (if you feel confident that the file is clear and legible).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Password-protected or incompatible PDFs<\/strong>: If you have password-protected your PDF\u2014or get an error that we can\u2019t access your PDF\u2014try either generating a new PDF or converting your PDF to a JPEG file. Then re-upload it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Duplicate or different files:<\/strong> If you upload a document online that is an <em>exact copy<\/em> of a physical document that you have already mailed to WES, there will not be any issues. If you upload a copy of a document that is <em>different than<\/em> the physical version of the same document that you have already sent by mail, this could lead to delays. Our evaluators will need to sort out which document is valid for completing your report. We will reach out to you if there is additional information, or further documentation, that we need in order to complete your report. Additionally, adding <em>entirely<\/em> <em>new<\/em> documents after your evaluation has already started might cause delays.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If none of these fixes work for you, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/contact-us\/\">contact us<\/a> and we\u2019ll help troubleshoot your file.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/send-electronic-academic-records\/\"><strong>How to Send <\/strong><strong>Electronic Academic Records to WES<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/understanding-wes-required-documents\/\">Understanding WES Required Documents<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":24721,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[214,556],"advisor_tags":[397,435],"better_featured_image":{"id":24721,"alt_text":"upload degree certificates","caption":"Shot of a young woman using a laptop while working from home","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2020\/06\/blog_20200603-iStock-875249534.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/blog_20200603-iStock-875249534-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"2","credit":"Getty Images","camera":"NIKON D800E","caption":"Shot of a young woman using a laptop while working from home","created_timestamp":"1493910815","copyright":"This content is subject to copyright.","focal_length":"35","iso":"500","shutter_speed":"0.0025","title":"Her home is a place for productivity","orientation":"1","keywords":[]}},"post":24663,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/blog_20200603-iStock-875249534.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"WES Advisor","author":{"ID":3295,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-14 17:53:55","post_content":"WES Advisor is an initiative of World Education Services, a non-profit organization with over 45 years of experience in international education.
