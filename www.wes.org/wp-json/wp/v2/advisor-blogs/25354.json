If you have additional questions, explore updates on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/important-wes-notices\/\">notifications page<\/a> or visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/help\">Help Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Keep reading to see the answers to your commonly asked questions:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>1. Are WES offices open?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>WES has remained open for business throughout the pandemic, and we remain fully committed to helping you achieve your goals in the U.S. and Canada. While physical office locations were temporarily closed in compliance with local safety regulations, our staff was able to work remotely to process thousands of documents (with support from a small, essential team in the mail room).<\/p>\n<p>Today, our standard operations have almost fully recovered. To stay updated with the latest information, please bookmark our new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/important-wes-notices\/\">notifications page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>2. My school is on lockdown due to the pandemic. All efforts to have my transcripts sent to WES have been unsuccessful. What should I do?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve already completed and submitted your application, reach out to your school to see what options you have. For example, your school may have a representative who is still working and can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/send-electronic-academic-records\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">submit documents electronically<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to WES on your behalf. WES will begin the evaluation process as soon as we receive your required documents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>3. As a result of the pandemic, I cannot obtain my transcripts from my university. What will become of the payment I have already made? How long is my payment valid?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do not delete applicant files due to inactivity. Therefore, your WES application will not be eliminated from our system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">required documents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be sent whenever it is feasible. In the meantime, we will keep your payment and application on file until we receive all of your required documents, at which point we will begin to process and review your documents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>4. How do I know if my school can submit electronic documents to WES?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First check the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Required Documents page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see the requirements for your country (or territory) and institution. If specific guidelines are not outlined on this page, don\u2019t worry, your school may still be able to send us your documents electronically. (We are frequently adding institutions and their respective digital transmission options to the <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\">Required Documents page<\/a> on a continual basis.)\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, we encourage you to have a representative from your institution <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/contact-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contact us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and select the \u201cOther\u201d category on the contact form. We will then explore electronic transmission opportunities with your institution.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>5. Does WES offer translation services?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>WES does not provide translation services, and requires most documents to be sent in English (with some exceptions for French in Canada). Learn more about translation requirements in this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/wes-translation-services\/\">blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>6. WES sent my university a verification request while it was closed due to the pandemic. Now my university has reopened, but they need a new verification request from WES. What should I do?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to do anything. WES automatically sends verification requests every seven weeks, via email, until we receive a response from the institution. To learn more about the verification process, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/verification-status\/\">refer to this blog post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>7. If I\u2019m calling customer service and cannot get through, what should I do?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If call volume is high, we encourage you to reach out using our Contact Us form. U.S. applicants should contact us using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/contact-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this form<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Canadian applicants should use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/contact-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this form<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>8. My documents have arrived at WES, but have not been processed. What\u2019s the status?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are continuing to increase our mail processing capabilities. Below are the latest document processing timeline estimates:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Documents received in our WES Canada office by September 2, 2020, will be processed by September 17, 2020.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Documents received in our WES Canada office by September 9, 2020, will be processed by September 24, 2020.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Documents received in our WES U.S. office are being processed within 3-5 business days.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(For newer updates to this timeline, please visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/important-wes-notices\/\">notifications page<\/a>.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Please check the delivery date provided by your courier or mail service to determine when you should expect your next status update in <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\/login\/login\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Account<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

I am having trouble uploading my documents to <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\/login\/login\/\">My Account<\/a>. I keep getting an error message.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re having this problem, it means you likely left your account idle and are no longer logged in. Try logging out and logging in; then try uploading your documents again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this solution doesn\u2019t work, you may be uploading a file type that is incompatible or too large. Or, you may get an error message if the image quality is poor or blurry, rendering the document illegible. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/upload-degree-certificates-and-translations\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This blog post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will help you troubleshoot common upload problems and their solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>10. What is the fastest way to receive my credential evaluation?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Here are a few tips that can help you receive your report as quickly as possible:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be sure to <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\/login\/login\/\">complete your application<\/a> and submit your payment online. WES accepts payment by credit card\/debit card, or Convera (Formerly Western Union), please be advised that all transactions to and from sanctioned and restricted jurisdictions have been suspended until further notice.
