In this post, we go into detail and discuss the many reasons why Canada is popular with international students pursuing undergraduate and graduate credentials.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skip Ahead<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get a Credential Evaluation Today<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Renowned institutions<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada is internationally recognized as having an exceptional standard for higher education. Canadian Universities regularly appear in international university rankings. For example, the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.topuniversities.com\/university-rankings\/world-university-rankings\/2022\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> QS World University Rankings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> included 26 Canadian Universities in 2021, and the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.timeshighereducation.com\/student\/best-universities\/best-universities-canada\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">THE World University Rankings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> included 32 Canadian Universities in 2022.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the top-ranked Canadian universities are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.utoronto.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Toronto<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ubc.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of British Columbia<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mcgill.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGill University<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.umontreal.ca\/en\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Montreal<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ualberta.ca\/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Alberta<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ucalgary.ca\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Calgary<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students move to Canada knowing the degree they earn will be globally recognized. This means there is a higher chance of successful employment in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Affordability<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe, tuition in Canada is affordable for the quality of education students receive. Plus, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/scholarships-canada-international-students-2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada offers several scholarships<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that help international students further cut down their educational expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada enables international students to achieve their dreams of studying abroad by offering a diverse range of higher education options which fit different types of budgets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Research opportunities<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something that sets higher education in Canada apart from most countries is its heavy emphasis on research and development. The Canadian government encourages research and innovation by offering financial support in fields like medicine, science, technology, environmental studies, agriculture, telecommunications, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an international student in Canada, you will have the opportunity to be involved in exciting academic projects. In Canadian universities, a curious and forward-thinking attitude is not only accepted, but highly encouraged. As a result, this opens doors for international students who want to be part of exciting developments and gain valuable experience for their career. Plus, many universities offer additional scholarships and bursaries for research work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Diversity<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada is one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/worldpopulationreview.com\/country-rankings\/most-racially-diverse-countries\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most racially diverse western countries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Its culture of openness and being welcoming to immigrants from all over the world makes it a great place to be an international student\u2014especially when you are so far away from your home country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an international student in Canada, you will be exposed to many cultures and varied ethnic groups. You will have the chance to learn from people who come from different countries both in the classroom and in society.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studying in Canada allows international students to broaden their horizons by meeting new people from all over the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Safety and security<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 2020 Global Peace Index, Canada was ranked the 10th safest nation in the world, in part because of its low crime rate. Canada was also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/best-countries\/quality-of-life-rankings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ranked first in the world<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by US News for its quality of life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canadian universities care about the safety and security of the students that attend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, many students choose to take advantage of university services like shuttles and security escorts. Some schools even offer apps where students can contact security when they need to. When students study in Canada, they are given liberty in terms of health and security. Plus, medical insurance is easily accessible to international students.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Work-study opportunities<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Canadian government provides many work study opportunities to international students. International students can work for up to 20 hours per week during semester terms and full-time during break periods. International students do not need extra permits for work\u2014all they need to provide is their student visa to secure a job.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students studying more technical fields also get special consideration for employment opportunities. Plus, in technical fields, students do not typically encounter issues with placement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Vibrant campus culture<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">School campuses in Canada are more than just places to study and learn. Campuses in Canada offer students a lively and vibrant culture to take part in. International students can expect things like on-campus events, student clubs, and festivals to happen at the university.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The campus culture is yet another good reason to study in Canada because it allows students to learn in a community-driven environment. This can help alleviate the feeling of homesickness and provides ample opportunities to meet people and grow your professional network.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Pathways to immigration and citizenship<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canada has a Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PWPP) that allows international students to stay and work in Canada for up to three years after completing their degree.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does this help international students gain valuable international work experience, but it is also a pathway that can lead to permanent residency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope this article has given you a good overview of the benefits of pursuing higher education in Canada.
