Many employers seek bilingual candidates to fill a wide range of roles within their organization and there is often less competition for these roles. By building a strong network within the bilingual community, there are many ways for French-speaking immigrants to succeed in Canada. Our Spotlight on Success this month, Imane Sahir, is proof of this.<\/p>\n<p>Imane Sahir participated in ACCES Employment\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accesemployment.ca\/index.php\/speed-mentoring-en-francais\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Speed Mentoring\u00ae en Fran\u00e7ais<\/a> program in 2016. Her experience led to many job opportunities, including her current position as a\u00a0bilingual account coordinator at International Financial Data Services.<\/p>\n<h4>Thank you for speaking with us Imane. Please tell us a bit about yourself.<\/h4>\n<p>I am from Morocco and I moved to Canada in 2015. I had three main careers in Morocco: a procurement manager, manager at a finance company, and quality assurance manager. I have a bachelor\u2019s degree in business\u00a0and economics, and a master\u2019s degree in logistics management, as well as audit and business control.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3751 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/blog_20170126-02-Imane_Sahir.jpg\" alt=\"Imane Sahir\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/blog_20170126-02-Imane_Sahir.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/blog_20170126-02-Imane_Sahir-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/blog_20170126-02-Imane_Sahir-90x90.jpg 90w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/blog_20170126-02-Imane_Sahir-185x185.jpg 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>How did you learn French?<\/h4>\n<p>I learned French in Morocco and used it when I studied and worked. I felt that speaking more than one language would benefit my career.<\/p>\n<h4>What were your career expectations before leaving for Canada and what did you experience after you arrived?<\/h4>\n<p>When I arrived in Canada, I wanted to find work as a procurement specialist. The most challenging part of the job search was finding recruiters who specialized in my area of expertise and employers looking specifically for French-speaking candidates.<\/p>\n<h4>How did you start your job search in Canada?<\/h4>\n<p>I tried to attend all of the bilingual events, job fairs, and mentoring sessions. I also searched online for bilingual opportunities. I wanted to use my language skills to find a job, but I didn\u2019t have a lot of luck when I first started looking for jobs.<\/p>\n<h4>What services and resources did you use to help with your job search?<\/h4>\n<p>I enrolled in a bridging program through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.collegeboreal.ca\/home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coll\u00e8ge Bor\u00e9al<\/a> and it was through this program that I learned of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accesemployment.ca\/index.php\/speed-mentoring-en-francais\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Speed Mentoring en Fran\u00e7ais<\/a>. This was a unique program that provided French-speaking job seekers with the opportunity to meet with employers who wanted French-speaking candidates.<\/p>\n<h4>How did Speed Mentoring en Fran\u00e7ais help you?<\/h4>\n<p>I was matched with employers who were actively looking to hire French-speaking individuals. It provided me with the chance to learn from mentors in my field, practice my networking skills, and find job opportunities.<\/p>\n<h4>Can you tell me how you went about finding your current job?<\/h4>\n<p>I found my current job through an employer I met at a Speed Mentoring en Fran\u00e7ais event. The employer provided me with information about a position that I was interested in applying to, and after the interview process, I was successful in securing the position.<\/p>\n<h4>Was your employer looking specifically for a French-speaking individual?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n<h4>Do you have any advice for French-speaking job seekers in Canada?<\/h4>\n<p>ACCES Employment offers a unique opportunity for French-speaking job seekers. Speed Mentoring en Fran\u00e7ais connects bilingual newcomers with employers who are looking to hire French-speaking candidates. Speed Mentoring en Fran\u00e7ais events allow newcomers to showcase their language skills and connect with employers who can provide advice on finding jobs that match their skills and experience. This networking opportunity can also lead to future job offers. I highly recommend it!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":3734,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[200,152],"advisor_tags":[7,75,407],"better_featured_image":{"id":3734,"alt_text":"Group of people in a professional meeting","caption":"Meeting Seminar Conference Business Collaboration Team Concept","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-150x150.jpg"},"testimonial-thumb":{"file":"blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-90x90.jpg","width":90,"height":90,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-90x90.jpg"},"carousel-post-thumb":{"file":"blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-540x277.jpg","width":540,"height":277,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-540x277.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"2.8","credit":"Getty Images\/iStockphoto","camera":"NIKON D3X","caption":"Meeting Seminar Conference Business Collaboration Team Concept","created_timestamp":"1441847446","copyright":"Rawpixel Ltd","focal_length":"32","iso":"100","shutter_speed":"0.000625","title":"Meeting Seminar Conference Business Collaboration Team Concept","orientation":"1","keywords":["Businesswoman","Businessman","Women","Group Of People","Seminar","Global Communications","Conference Table","Global Business","Leadership","Teamwork","Discussion","Business","Back Lit","Urban Scene","Indoors","Business Person","Professional Occupation","Occupation","Window","Cityscape"]}},"post":3733,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/blog_20170126_Leadership_iStock_73748703.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Beth Gallagher","author":{"ID":3422,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 16:50:47","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 16:50:47","post_content":"Beth Gallagher is a Marketing and Communications Specialist at ACCES Employment.","post_title":"Beth Gallagher","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"beth-gallagher","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:38:47","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:38:47","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=3422","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"external_contributor":true},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Spotlight on Success: Imane Sahir\u2014Career Opportunities for a French-Speaking Newcomer in Canada - World Education Services<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"French-speaking newcomers have great potential to utilize their language skills in Canada.
