First, it&#8217;s important to understand the Canadian labour market and your role in it.<\/p>\n<p>Preliminary research will help you identify the best job opportunities based on your skills. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/canada-archive-using-labour-market-information-to-inform-your-job-search-in-canada.html\">recent webinar<\/a>, we discussed the importance of using labour market information to prepare for a career in Canada. We also looked at a few essential research tools. In this blog post, we will review some of those tools and discuss why they are so important to your job search.<\/p>\n<h4>Exploring the Canadian Labour Market<\/h4>\n<p>First, it&#8217;s important to explain what we mean by \u201clabour market.\u201d The Canadian labour market is an interaction between supply (workers) and demand (jobs).<\/p>\n<p>However, Canada is a large country. What may be a thriving industry in one province may be a faltering one in another. Employment opportunities and job market trends are unique in each region. You should consider the talent supply and the jobs available within the specific region where you would like to live and work. Labour market health is also specific to each job sector.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, you need to look at four components, all together:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the specific number of jobs available<\/li>\n<li>the amount of talent competing for those jobs<\/li>\n<li>the need for talent within your own industry<\/li>\n<li>the number of job openings in the area where you would like to live and work<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course, you are the last piece of the puzzle when it comes to determining your potential for success. It will be up to you to define your own place in the job market\u2014taking into account your own mobility, your education, your skills, and your past experience.<\/p>\n<p>A WES credential evaluation can also help you make your international education and past experience clear to employers in Canada. To learn more about why a credential evaluation might help with your job search, explore some of the following resources:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/credential-evaluation-changed-my-life\/\">How a Credential Evaluation Changed My Life<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/make-the-wes-credential-evaluation-process-work-for-you\/\">7 Ways to Make the Credential Evaluation Process Work for You<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/wes-credential-evaluation-process\/\">The WES Credential Evaluation Process Explained<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/wesadvisor-webinar-archive-the-lifetime-value-of-a-wes-credential-evaluation.html\">Webinar: The Lifetime Value of a Credential Evaluation<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Importance of Labour Market Research<\/h4>\n<p>Your research results will help you to determine where you want to live in Canada. You can also determine what type of work to pursue. Taking time to fully understand the Canadian labour market as it relates to your field of work will help you make more informed decisions. As a result, the career plan you develop will ensure that you can put your talent to its fullest use.<\/p>\n<p>Exploring the labour market within your sector will also determine how your experience, education, and skills compare with those of professionals currently in your field in Canada. This insight will help you to find your place and value in the sector.<\/p>\n<p>Through your research, you may discover alternative job titles that may be more lucrative. Conducting labour market research will reveal many more options for your career in Canada.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/top-10-demand-technology-careers\/?country=canada\">Top 10 In-Demand Technology Careers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Research Considerations<\/h4>\n<p>There are a number of ways to research the Canadian labour market.

According to its website, NOC \u201cgathers more than 30,000 occupational titles into 500 unit groups, organized according to skill levels and skill types.\u201d Using the site\u2019s quick search function, you can find the NOC code for your profession. The same NOC codes are used on other Government of Canada labour market sites. This code can be useful for verifying that a role is within your skill set and level.<\/p>\n<p>Each occupation has assigned codes and provides the following information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Main duties and tasks<\/li>\n<li>Sample job titles<\/li>\n<li>Education\/training requirements<\/li>\n<li>Experience needed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The NOC system is a valuable starting point for your labour market research. Here you will become familiar with your profession\u2019s common job titles. You will also be able to compare your previous experience with the functions of your desired role in Canada.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/silicon-valley-north-toronto-waterloo\/?country=canada\">Silicon Valley North: The Toronto-Waterloo Corridor<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h5>Job Bank<\/h5>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jobbank.gc.ca\/explorecareers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Job Bank<\/a>, maintained by the Government of Canada, is a database used to explore the outlook of professions for the next five or ten years.
