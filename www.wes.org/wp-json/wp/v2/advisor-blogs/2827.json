Having good credit is particularly essential if you plan to remain in the U.S. after your studies, so building a good credit score for yourself is something you will need to begin as soon as you can.<\/p>\n<p>So how can you build credit as an international student? Credit cards are a great way to quickly build credit, and here are a few tips for acquiring and using credit cards:<\/p>\n<h4>Apply for a Card Made for International Students<\/h4>\n<p>The easiest way to acquire a credit card is by applying for one that is made specifically for international students.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.selfscore.com\/mastercard\/#pg-13280-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SelfScore<\/a> is a credit card that requires no Social Security number, has a low-interest rate, and doesn\u2019t charge an annual fee. To quickly start building your credit score, SelfScore may be the solution you need.<\/p>\n<h4>Get a Social Security Number\/Taxpayer ID<\/h4>\n<p>To apply for most credit cards in the U.S., you will need a U.S. Social Security number or an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), which can act as a \u201cdatabase\u201d for your financial history.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/secure.ssa.gov\/ICON\/main.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Applying for a U.S. Social Security number<\/a> can be a long process, so it&#8217;s best to start as early as possible. If you aren\u2019t eligible for a Social Security number, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/fw7.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apply for an ITIN number<\/a>. Remember, you will need a proof of identification (such as a passport) and proof of foreign status (visa).<\/p>\n<h4>Check with Your University<\/h4>\n<p>Your university may be able to assist you in getting a credit card. They could instruct you on whether to apply for a Social Security number or an ITIN number. Many universities even have special arrangements with banks to make it easier for international students to obtain a credit card. Your university is there as a resource for you, so use it if you need help in deciding what next step to take in building your credit history.<\/p>\n<h4>Use Your Credit Card Responsibly<\/h4>\n<p>The credit system takes time to adjust to, especially for international students who come from countries that still run on cash. Don\u2019t be afraid to use your credit card. At the same time, give yourself a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selfscore.com\/resources\/financial-advice\/the-truth-about-the-20-rule\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monthly limit<\/a> of what you can spend on the credit card, so you don\u2019t overspend and surpass your budget. Selfscore has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selfscore.com\/resources\/financial-advice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">some great resources<\/a> on how to spend with a credit card wisely.<\/p>\n<h4>Make Your Payments on Time, Every Time<\/h4>\n<p>The most important aspect of maintaining a good credit score is to always pay on time. It also means you won\u2019t get stuck with late payment fees!<\/p>\n<h4>Check Your Credit Score<\/h4>\n<p>Once you have established credit, be sure to check your score. This is especially important if you are about to enter into an agreement that requires a credit check. You should check your credit score about once per year. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.myfico.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FICO<\/a> is a commonly used resource to check credit scores, but there are also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/laurengensler\/2015\/05\/13\/free-credit-score\/2\/#4de3b4b6df47\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many free options<\/a> available for you to check your score.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on building credit and obtaining a credit card, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/blog\/credit-cards\/how-to-get-a-credit-card-for-international-students-and-immigrant-workers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">read this article<\/a> for plenty of more useful information.<\/p>\n<p>Do you have first-hand experience with building credit as an international student in the U.S.?
