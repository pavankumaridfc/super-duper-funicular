The most common exams are the Test of English as a\u00a0Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing Service (IELTS).<\/p>\n<p>These two exams are administered by two different companies\u2014and now that you know\u00a0that, you may be left wondering, \u201cWhat option would be the best for me?\u201d\u00a0Do not worry!

Therefore, the exam is conducted in U.S. English.\u00a0The test is administered either via paper or the Internet, depending on where you take the test. The Internet-based test is commonly called TOEFL iBT and accepted by more\u00a0than 8,500 institutions worldwide. The TOEFL test can be taken more than 50 times a\u00a0year and students can retake it as many times as they want. However, you are allowed to\u00a0take it only once every 12 days. Keep in mind too that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ets.org\/toefl\/ibt\/about\/fees\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost of the test<\/a> ranges anywhere from $160 to $250 USD, depending on where you take the test.<\/p>\n<p>The TOEFL is broken into four sections that test each student on their Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing abilities. The entire test takes four and a half hours overall, with scores ranging from 0\u2013120 points.<\/p>\n<h4>The IELTS Test<\/h4>\n<p>The IELTS test is administered by three companies: the British Council,\u00a0the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations, and IDP Education Australia. As a result,\u00a0the test uses U.K. English. For students more familiar with U.K. English, the IELTS may be\u00a0a better option. Like the TOEFL, you can take the exam either as a computer-based test\u00a0(CBT) or paper-based test. The IELTS is accepted by more than 8,000 organizations\u00a0worldwide. One of the main differences of the IELTS is that you can take an Academic exam or\u00a0General Training exam. The Academic exam is geared toward those seeking to enter\u00a0university whereas the General Training exam is more for individuals planning to immigrate to English-speaking countries.<\/p>\n<p>The IELTS is offered up to four times a month worldwide. While the exact cost is determined by your local currency, if you take the test in the U.S., it costs around $215 to $240 USD. Similar to the TOEFL,\u00a0the IELTS is broken into four sections: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking.\u00a0However, the speaking portion of the exam is administered face-to-face by a native\u00a0speaker. The entire exam takes about two hours and 45 minutes and test scores range\u00a0between 0\u20139 with half scores.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a comparison of test scores for TOEFL and IELTS:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wesstudentadvisor.org\/2013\/11\/toefl-vs-ielts-for-english-exams.html\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/TOEFLvsIELTS2.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>*Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ets.org\/toefl\/institutions\/scores\/compare\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.ets.org\/toefl\/institutions\/scores\/compare\/<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>So, if you are an international student thinking about studying abroad in the U.S. be sure to confirm with the schools that you will apply to for their testing\u00a0requirements.
