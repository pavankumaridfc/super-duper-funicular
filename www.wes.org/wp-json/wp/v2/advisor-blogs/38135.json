For anyone considering the move, it is a smart idea to understand the process and requirements. Those seeking immigration to the U.S. or Canada for education, employment, or to pursue other new opportunities will likely find that a credential evaluation is required.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This might lead you to wonder, when is the best time to obtain a credential evaluation?

Below are a few benefits to consider.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"3\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Inform your research\u00a0<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Obtaining a credential evaluation before you apply for academic programs or employment can help guide your efforts, as you will know at the outset how your current qualifications are viewed in the U.S. or Canada.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">From there, you can decide whether or not you need to undertake additional coursework or training before approaching a particular academic institution or employer.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"3\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Save time and money<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p aria-level=\"3\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">We have heard many stories of internationally trained immigrants who did not receive a credential evaluation and made the mistake of repeating coursework or an educational level that was already equivalent to their current qualifications.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You can imagine how much time and money could be wasted by making this mistake. Understanding the U.S. or Canadian equivalency of your international coursework and credentials will ensure that you select the most appropriate courses, programs, or training opportunities to further your education or career.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Be prepared<\/span><\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once you receive your credential evaluation, you will be prepared for new opportunities when they arise. Some applicants make the mistake of waiting until an academic institution or potential employer requests a credential evaluation. Having your credential evaluation report available when you need it will help you reach your career and education goals more quickly.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You might also discover unexpected opportunities to use your credential evaluation report. For example, some international student scholarship applications may ask you to provide proof of your academic achievements. Having a credential evaluation report in hand could help the scholarship provider make an informed and fair decision. \u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:180,&quot;335559739&quot;:180}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"2\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Start Your Credential Evaluation Early<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In short, your credential evaluation will be a valuable tool to help you reach your educational or professional goals in the U.S. or Canada.

However, they can be renewed. To extend the validity of a WES ECA, applicants can sign into My Account and order an additional copy of the ECA for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.
