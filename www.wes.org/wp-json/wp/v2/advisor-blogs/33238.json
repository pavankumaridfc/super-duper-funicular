As of October 2021, WES evaluates credentials from most higher education institutions in Pakistan. We achieved this important policy change, which aligns with our mission to help immigrants thrive, by working with Pakistan\u2019s education authorities, including the Higher Education Commission (HEC).<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>How does the new policy help individuals educated in Pakistan?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new policy means that we now evaluate documents from nearly double the number of schools in Pakistan. T<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">housands of individuals are newly eligible for credential evaluations from WES. Now, many more students from that region will have their experience and skills fully acknowledged if they wish to relocate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For individuals whose schools are recognized by HEC, there is an added advantage: After applying to WES, they will be directed to send their academic documents directly to HEC (who will ensure those documents correctly and efficiently reach WES). This eliminates guesswork for the applicant and reduces the chance of introducing errors or creating delays.<\/span>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/hec.gov.pk\/english\/services\/students\/Equivalence%20Degree%20Issuance\/Pages\/Procedure\/Procedure-foreign.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information about that process is available here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, WES evaluates documents from over 200 institutions in Pakistan. Because WES is the leading provider of credential evaluations in North America, with global partnerships and recognized equivalency reports, this is an advantage for anyone educated in Pakistan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Try the Free Tool<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/required-documents\">Preview Your Required Documents<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4><b>How can you find out if your school is eligible for a credential evaluation?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how to learn if your Pakistani institution currently qualifies for an equivalency report from WES:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply for a credential evaluation from WES<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you proceed, you will see a dropdown menu that allows you to list the institutions you have attended. If your institution is on this list, then we evaluate its credentials.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is one exception: If your school is not on our dropdown list, then you can add the name of your institution manually and proceed. WES is frequently adding new schools, and it is possible that we have added your school very recently and it is not yet showing up on our list. If you submit your application and it turns out that we cannot verify your credentials, then we will reach out to you right away to let you know and refund your full payment.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope that this new policy makes it easier for you to pursue your employment and education goals in the United States or Canada.
