This number represents 19.6 percent of all international students in the U.S. in 2018. Additionally, this figure reveals a growth trend: 1.5 percent more students majored in engineering in 2018 than in 2017. But engineering is a broad field, and you will have to choose a more specific major; understandably, you might want to choose your focus based on the highest demand for employment. According to a 2019 report from<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/newengineer.com\/insight\/8-of-the-most-in-demand-engineering-jobs-for-2019-1126177\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NewEngineer.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the most in-demand engineering jobs fall into the categories of data science and machine learning (a branch of software engineering). Those popular fields are followed closely by robotics engineers and petroleum engineers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Computer Science:<\/strong> Ranked a close second to engineering, according to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open Doors,<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is computer and information science (which is often referred to as CS). In 2018, 144,574 international students selected CS as their major\u2014a 13.5 percent increase from the previous year. The popularity of computer science corresponds with the U.S.\u2019s high-growth information technology field\u2014but IT is only one of several career options for those with a degree in CS. In 2017, computer programmers enjoyed a median annual wage of $82,240, according to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/computer-and-information-technology\/computer-programmers.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Other Top STEM Majors:<\/strong> Coming third on the list is biological and biomedical sciences, with a total of 41,589 international students enrolled as of 2018; however, it ranks a distant third behind your first two options. This field of study is followed closely in popularity by mathematics and statistics (41,429 international students) and physical sciences (34,484 international students).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote><p>Watch the Webinar<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/wesadvisor-webinar-archive-us-undergraduate-admissions-for-international-students.html\">U.S. Undergraduate Admissions for International Students<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>STEM Programs for Business Majors<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might have also heard about business degree programs that require a lot of STEM classes. In these cases, it is possible for your business degree program to qualify as a STEM major. If so, your degree might be even more valuable when it comes to future job prospects and higher education opportunities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business degree program requires a significant number of STEM-related courses\u2014such as math, statistics, or IT\u2014then there is a good chance that it can be designated a STEM major. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, an information system program made up mainly of courses in data analytics, computer science, or engineering can be considered a STEM program\u2014even if it is offered at a business school. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency have published a list of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.laborimmigration.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/stem-list-Jan-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEM-Designated Degree Programs<\/span><\/a>.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can check to see if your program is eligible, or check with your school&#8217;s admissions office.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Learn More: Read the E-Guide<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/knowledge.wes.org\/WESAdvisor-Eguide-US-Application-Process.html\">The U.S. College Application Process<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>OPT Extensions for STEM Majors<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to a positive career outlook, there is another benefit that might encourage you to enroll in a STEM major in the United States: an extension of your Optional Practical Training (OPT). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students pursuing a STEM degree in the U.S. qualify for a 17-month extension after their 12-month OPT expires. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, STEM students can receive up to 29 months total of OPT. You can use this time to work or intern in the U.S. after completing your degree.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International students pursuing a STEM major are likely to encounter a prosperous job market in the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although STEM careers require a lot of preparation and commitment, it might be worth the hard work. That&#8217;s because you can expect a positive outlook for STEM careers in the United States\u2014both now and in the foreseeable future.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Related Reading<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/stem-studies-in-the-u-s\/\">How to Pursue STEM Studies in the U.S.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/stem-careers-canada-job-prospects\/\">STEM Careers in Canada<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":15960,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","format":"standard","advisor_categories":[135],"advisor_tags":[397,487,5],"better_featured_image":{"id":15960,"alt_text":"popular STEM programs","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":635,"height":423,"file":"2019\/03\/blog_20190319_iStock-892541856.jpg","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-300x200.jpg","width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-300x200.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"file":"blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-150x150.jpg","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-150x150.jpg"},"team":{"file":"blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-185x185.jpg","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-185x185.jpg"},"people":{"file":"blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-394x276.jpg","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-394x276.jpg"},"insight":{"file":"blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-541x362.jpg","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/blog_20190319_iStock-892541856-541x362.jpg"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":15953,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/blog_20190319_iStock-892541856.jpg"},"acf":{"author_name":"Xiao Lu","author":{"ID":3448,"post_author":"10","post_date":"2017-04-18 18:16:57","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-18 18:16:57","post_content":"Xiao Lu is a Marketing Associate\u00a0at World Education Services.","post_title":"Xiao Lu","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"xiao-lu","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-03 14:35:17","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-03 19:35:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/?post_type=authors&#038;p=3448","menu_order":0,"post_type":"authors","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"external_contributor":false},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Top 5: STEM Majors for International Students<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Interested in pursuing a degree in science, technology, engineering, or math?
