He studied business administration with a focus on marketing and international business and received a bachelor\u2019s degree with honours in 2021.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Upon completing his undergraduate education, he began to think about graduate school and form career plans. After considering several options, he moved to Canada to pursue a Master of Business Administration from New York Institute of Technology \u2013 Vancouver.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">While working toward his graduate degree, Zeyad decided to secure work that aligned with his goals. Interested in learning about becoming a Salesforce administrator, Zeyad was delighted to find an open position with WES as an Administrative and Communication Coordinator whose role would be to help implement Salesforce at the organization.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Zeyad believed this opportunity synced perfectly with his career goals and values.

By including the evaluation in his application, Zeyad secured his acceptance into the program; moreover, the university waived nine credits of coursework, which will fast-track his studies.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Zeyad also notes that the evaluation played a crucial role in making him eligible for an entrance <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/scholarships-canada-international-students-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">scholarship<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Throughout his journey, Zeyad encountered some challenges as an international student. We asked him what tips he would share with his peers to make the credential evaluation experience and study abroad in Canada as smooth as possible for them:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Plan ahead<br \/>\n<\/strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are considering studying abroad and think you will need a WES credential evaluation, it is important to start the process early. Ask your school for official transcripts in a signed, stamped, and sealed envelope. Zeyad says, \u201cHaving these on hand will save you time and effort when you decide to apply for a [credential] evaluation.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Select ICAP for your evaluation.<br \/>\n<\/strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When ordering your WES credential evaluation, consider selecting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/wes-international-credential-advantage-package\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Credential Advantage Package (ICAP)<\/a>. Though ICAP does cost more than the basic package, it\u2019s a smart investment, according to Zeyad. \u201cThe ICAP evaluation provides additional documents that can be useful for future applications, such as immigration and employment processes in Canada.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Keep your important documents safe.<br \/>\n<\/strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When you receive your final transcripts, make sure to keep them in a secure place. Zeyad notes, \u201cHaving signed and sealed transcripts on hand can be helpful for various things, like applying to universities, seeking scholarships, or meeting visa requirements.\u201d<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>4.\u00a0Stay organized.<br \/>\n<\/strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">During the process, remember to keep all important papers, emails, and communications related to the WES evaluation organized and accessible. Being organized will make things easier and faster for you. Zeyad says, \u201cStaying organized will help ensure a smooth and efficient experience.\u201d<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Be prepared for potential delays.\u00a0<\/strong><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Watch out for possible delays and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/advisor-blog\/when-is-the-best-time-to-obtain-a-credential-evaluation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plan ahead<\/a>, especially if you need to meet tight deadlines. Zeyad says, \u201cThe evaluation process may take some time, so be patient.\u201d<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Double-check requirements.<br \/>\n<\/strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Before sending your documents for any application, confirm the university or institution\u2019s requirements. Zeyad notes, \u201cEnsure that you have included all necessary documents to avoid any delays in the admission process.\u201d<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Seek guidance.<br \/>\n<\/strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remember to ask any questions you may have about credential evaluation and regarding relocating to another country. Zeyad adds, \u201cIf you have any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/ca\/help\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">questions or concerns about the evaluation process<\/a>, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to WES or the educational institution you are applying to.\u201d<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Embracing <\/span><\/b><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">N<\/span><\/b><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">ew Goals and Challenges<\/span><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Zeyad\u2019s journey as an international student has been guided by his parents\u2019 belief in the power of an education.
