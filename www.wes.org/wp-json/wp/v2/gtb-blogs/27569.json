Having access to this timely information supports the decision-making of employers, workers, job seekers, and others. LMIC and WES assess the relevance, accuracy, and quality of each report in the new migration section so that all stakeholders can benefit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Rapidly Changing Work Environment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Newcomers to Canada soon discover that the country\u2019s work environment is dynamic.
