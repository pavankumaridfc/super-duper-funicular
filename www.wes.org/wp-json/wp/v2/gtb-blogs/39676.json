The 16 participating communities<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> collaborated in sub-cohorts that centered on four thematic focus areas: Advancing and Retaining Internationally Skilled Employees, Creating Career Navigation Tools and Resources, Developing Contextualized Digital Skills Opportunities, and Workforce Board Partnerships. This new SIIP structure created intimate communities of practice, uniting cities, regions, and states working on similar initiatives to support internationally trained and educated immigrants and refugees.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>In Colorado: Laying the Groundwork for New Initiatives<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Anthony Cherwinski of Colorado\u2019s Office of New Americans said, \u201cParticipation in the SIIP has advanced the work of my overall goal to support the integration of new Americans into my state\u2019s economy.\u201d As the lead for his office\u2019s participation in the <strong>Advancing and Retaining Internationally Skilled Employees<\/strong> sub-cohort, he added, \u201cI always remind employers, state officials, and community-based organizations that while new programs are needed, much of this work involves the dismantling of old systems built without inclusivity in mind. Through SIIP, I was [also] able to collaborate with colleagues in my state to gather essential data which guided next steps in training development and programs for new Americans, employers, state programs, and community-based organizations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Working alongside colleagues in Colorado\u2019s state government, the City of Denver\u2019s Workforce Development Board and New Americans Integration Network also focused on gathering and disseminating data about immigrant and refugee communities to their multi-sector stakeholder network, as well as within the city. As part of the <strong>Workforce Board Partnerships<\/strong> sub-cohort, Denver Workforce Services distributed a survey to identify baseline understanding of the immigrant and refugee population among internal staff, contracted partners, and members of the Denver Workforce Development Board. The results informed a professional development training given to nearly 200 Workforce Development Board members in the Colorado area, on the needs and potential impact of the region\u2019s internationally trained immigrants and refugees. A co-lead for her community, Logann Grasteit, Workforce Development Board Liaison and Senior Management Analyst for the City of Denver, said, \u201cSIIP was a compass in helping us drive an initiative forward with purpose, intention, and clarity. We could not have had such a well-rounded and collaborative project without the support and connections made through SIIP.\u201d<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_39680\" style=\"width: 635px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-39680\" class=\"wp-image-39680\" src=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Screenshot-490-300x169.png\" alt=\"Zoom call screenshot of program members\" width=\"625\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Screenshot-490-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Screenshot-490-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Screenshot-490-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Screenshot-490-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Screenshot-490.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-39680\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of the SIIP 2022-2023 cohort at their final Quarterly Call<\/p><\/div>\n<h4><strong>In <\/strong><strong>Washington: Developing Tools to Support Local Efforts<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>As part of the <strong>Creating Career Navigation Tools and Resources<\/strong> sub-cohort, Jewish Family Service (JFS) of Seattle developed a robust multi-sector network to further workforce inclusion for the city\u2019s immigrants and refugees. Partnering with organizations such as the Puget Sound Welcome Back Center at Highline College, Washington Academy for International Medical Graduates (WAIMG), TRAC Associates, Project Feast, and Skillspire, JFS led the creation of career development materials specific to Washington State. These materials focused on in-demand professions in the Seattle area, including information technology and coding, teaching, and the culinary arts.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c[JFS Seattle] staff streamlined their template and feedback process to capture just the right amount of information to localize their guides. JFS partner agencies, mentoring volunteers, and SIIP cohort members all provided guidance for content resources, which will connect to the WES Global Talent Bridge Career Pathways e-guides and online tool for more information. The structure of SIIP allowed Seattle to advance from idea to draft product and gave them the time to envision a better system for information sharing among agency partners serving immigrants and refugees, as well as the opportunity to implement the first stage of that process.\u201d<br \/>\n&#8211; Hillary Gardner, Creating Career Navigation Tools and Resources technical assistance provider<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4><strong>In <\/strong><strong>Texas: Expanding Digital Inclusion<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The City of Dallas participated in the <strong>Developing Contextualized Digital Skills Opportunities<\/strong> sub-cohort, during which time the city applied for and <a href=\"https:\/\/content.govdelivery.com\/accounts\/TXDALLAS\/bulletins\/34e9cb9\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">received<\/a> $700,000 from the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Affordable Connectivity Program Outreach Grant Program with the aim of expanding digital inclusion to the city\u2019s immigrant and refugee communities. Discussing the importance of Dallas receiving this funding, Estefania Ramirez, Digital Equity Coordinator for the City of Dallas, said, \u201cThe City of Dallas is thrilled to receive funding through the Federal Communications Commission as the lead applicant in collaboration with Dallas County, Dallas Independent School District, and Dallas Housing Authority to conduct widespread engagement and outreach campaigns to reach millions of residents served by all our agencies\u2026,\u201d including the city\u2019s immigrant and refugee populations. \u201cThe funding will also allow partners to support the informal network of information disseminators at non-profits and other community-based organizations working to reach unconnected communities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Altogether, the 16 communities engaged in SIIP\u2019s four 2022-2023 \u00a0sub-cohorts used a variety of targeted approaches to promote immigrant and refugee economic inclusion in their areas.
