Straightaway, he was struck by the lack of opportunities to work in medicine or in a health care role that made use of his skills and experience. Despite graduating from one of the top medical schools in Bangladesh and working there as a physician, he became one of the many internationally trained physicians who face significant barriers accessing medical licensure in the United States.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">In <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">2020<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">, Dr. Islam was able to obtain a limited permit to begin practicing medicine under the supervision of a fully licensed physician. \u201cServing patients in New York has been my greatest privilege. After calling New York home, it was incredibly rewarding to give back to my community. I love going to work every day, knowing that I will help and make an impact on people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Dr. Islam.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Yet Dr. Islam may not be able to continue his work with the patients of Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, since New York State&#8217;s limited permit only allows internationally trained physicians to practice medicine for an initial two years with one renewal. This permit is a critical pathway for internationally trained physicians who reside in the state to practice medicine in New York without first having to complete a U.S. residency; and while the New York State Education Department has the discretion to authorize additional permit renewals, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.op.nysed.gov\/professions\/physicians\/license-requirements\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">in practice it has allowed limited permits to be renewed only once<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> for a total of four years of practice.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to know that, despite years of providing quality care to patients in Bangladesh and New York, I may have to give up my career because there is no pathway for me to continue practicing medicine once my limited permit renewal expires,\u201d said Dr. Islam. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3 aria-level=\"2\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Trained Immigrants as Part of the Solution to Health Care Shortages\u00a0<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">There is an urgent need to address health care shortages in <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">New York, where almost 5 million people who live in 183 federally designated primary care <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/data.hrsa.gov\/default\/generatehpsaquarterlyreport\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs)<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> have limited access to medical services.<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">The state is projected to need an additional <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.graham-center.org\/content\/dam\/rgc\/documents\/maps-data-tools\/state-collections\/workforce-projections\/New%20York.pdf\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">1,220<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> primary care physicians by 2030.<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">At the same time, <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">internationally trained physicians are ready to contribute their training and experience to address the state\u2019s health care shortage.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Immigrants already play a fundamental role in the delivery of health care services.

There are a number of states that have addressed licensing reform at the legislative and administrative level in health care, and we are delighted that New York State has a bill under consideration to try to expand an existing limited license to practice that international medical graduates have,\u201d said Paul Feltman, Deputy Executive Director of WES Global Talent Bridge, in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JglBmymymEQ\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">a webinar hosted by the Rockefeller Institute<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\">.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">New York\u2019s proposed legislation, S7002B, under consideration since early 2023, is a crucial step to ensure ongoing access to medical practice. As drafted, S7002B will allow internationally trained physicians to renew a limited permit every two years indefinitely, in turn allowing them to continue providing quality care to New Yorkers. The legislation would also dramatically increase employment opportunities for those holding permits, expanding the number and types of entities allowed to employ them. By allowing Dr. Islam and others to keep working and serving patients in New York, the bill would also help mitigate the existing health care shortage in the state.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Governor Hochul<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">has consistently expressed her commitment to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.governor.ny.gov\/news\/governor-hochul-announces-expansion-statewide-program-help-high-skilled-immigrants-find-jobs\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">expanding access to occupational licensure and employment<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> to internationally trained individuals,<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> recognizing that opening doors to immigrant talent benefits the entire state. \u201cBy connecting work-eligible individuals with jobs and opportunity in New York, we can &#8230; secure a brighter future for all New Yorkers,\u201d Governor Hochul said in a 2023 announcement regarding an initiative to integrate migrants and asylum seekers into the state\u2019s workforce. Proposed legislation S7002B<\/span> <span data-contrast=\"none\">presents a significant opportunity for New York to continue advancing these shared interests and join states such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/leg.colorado.gov\/bills\/hb22-1050\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Colorado<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> and <\/span><a

trained physicians themselves who hold permits, the state economy to which they contribute, and New Yorkers in need of medical care. \u201cNew York is my home, and my patients are my family,\u201d said Dr. Islam. \u201cI would appreciate any opportunities to continue serving New Yorkers.\u201d WES, alongside other advocates, hopes to see this bill enacted in this legislative session, to safeguard the ability of physicians like Dr. Islam to continue to practice.\u00a0<\/span><span
