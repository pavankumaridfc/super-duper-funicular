Led by Brooke Valle, a technical assistance provider for SIIP\u2019s Workforce Board Partnerships cohort, the panel included Erica Bouris, director of economic empowerment at the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Lei Ma, senior program associate with the World Education Services (WES) Mariam Assefa Fund. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The panelists provided an overview of frameworks for defining job quality, approaches to uplift immigrant voices in the development and implementation of employee benefits, ways to work with businesses that want to become choice employers, and suggestions on ways to engage with funders to support this work.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">How Job Quality Connects with DEI\u00a0<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/work-us\/job-quality-toolkit#:~:text=Job%20quality%20is%20not%20just,%2C%20skills%20building%2C%20and%20advancement.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Job quality<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> is not contingent on a single set of parameters. Rather, job quality relies on a combination of factors\u2014ranging from wages to schedule flexibility to career advancement opportunities\u2014that are unique to each employee and meet the needs of both workers and employers. The U.S. Department of Commerce points to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as a key driver of \u201chigh-quality jobs.\u201d In fact, according to a 2021 CNBC\/SurveyMonkey Workforce Survey, nearly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/curiosity\/cnbc-workforce-survey-april-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">80 percent of workers<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> want to work for a company that values DEI.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet employers do not always consider which aspects of a job may impact or prove attractive to immigrant and refugee employees, such as English language upskilling opportunities and routes to licensure. \u201cPathways to good jobs really only further DEI if they are open to all individuals,\u201d said Brooke Valle, co-author of Results for America\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/protect-us.mimecast.com\/s\/iqlSCqxoymu1w8oqCEfM5i?domain=jobquality.results4america.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Job Quality Playbook<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and the Families and Workers Fund\u2019s Job Quality Measurement Initiative report, <\/span><em><a href=\"https:\/\/protect-us.mimecast.com\/s\/TKHWCrkpznurJ8GgCjAhId?domain=familiesandworkers.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reimagining Job Quality Measurement<\/a><\/em><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

Through interviews with a diverse group of immigrant and refugee workers in Florida, Georgia, and West Texas, the IRC found that employees consistently identified challenges related to traditional aspects of job quality such as wages, hours, and work conditions, as well as considerations like a desire for respect, fairness, and opportunity. Important to note is that workers who reported experiences of lower job quality connected these experiences with their intersectional identities as an immigrant, person of color, or English language learner. \u201cThe perception of what makes a good or fair job has a lot to do with whatever your last job was in your home country,\u201d Erica noted, emphasizing that one\u2019s understanding of job quality is both individual and culturally specific.\u00a0<\/span><span

Erica suggested that employers and service providers develop programs that reflect the unique perspectives and needs of immigrant and refugee workers. \u201cAs a funder [\u2026] it\u2019s important to
