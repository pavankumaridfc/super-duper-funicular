The evaluation report converts the academic achievements of an international candidate to U.S. or Canadian terms.<\/p>\n<p>All WES evaluations are based on authenticated or verified transcripts received directly from the institutions that issue them. The ICAP service allows WES to share those academic records with institutions that students designate. This single and secure package can be delivered either electronically or in paper form.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Universities are seeking to streamline processes in these difficult economic times,&#8221; said Daniel J. Bennett, Assistant Dean Graduate Admissions\/Student and Academic Affairs, UCLA Graduate Division. &#8220;A service that eliminates steps, saves time, and reduces mistakes by ensuring that international transcripts are authentic is valuable to both universities and students alike.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Delivering key academic documents electronically in a single package allows universities to review applications quickly and respond to students in a timely manner.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Having the evaluation report and authentic transcript accessible electronically and securely in a single integrated package makes it easier to share the application with departmental admissions committees and other decision makers,&#8221; said Myron A. Thompson, Associate Provost and Executive Director of the Graduate School, University at Buffalo\/SUNY. &#8220;For students, obtaining a transcript once is cost-effective.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>WES Executive Director Mariam Assefa said initial student response to the new enhanced service in pilot testing has been very positive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;ICAP helps to make the admissions process faster and less complicated for everyone, especially students,&#8221; Assefa said. &#8220;Having WES forward authenticated transcripts with evaluation reports electronically allows international students to meet admissions deadlines.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About WES<\/strong>: World Education Services Inc.
