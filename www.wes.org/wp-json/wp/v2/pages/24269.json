For all evaluations and orders of additional copies of reports that were completed after March 10, you can access an unofficial copy of your report on your <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\/login\/login\/\">My Account<\/a> page. You can email this unofficial copy of your report to your institution. We have notified universities, institutional partners, licensing bodies, and immigration authorities that aren\u2019t currently set up to receive electronic evaluation reports about this change and are encouraging them to accept this unofficial copy of your report as evidence of your accomplishments until official reports are available again.<\/p>\n<h4>Answering Frequently Asked Questions<\/h4>\n<p>We have compiled a list of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/help#\/path\/COVID-19-FAQ\/\">most common questions<\/a> being asked as a result of the pandemic.<\/p>\n<h3>April 30, 2020<\/h3>\n<p>The goals, dreams, and ambitions of international students, immigrants, and refugees are not easily put aside. Nor are ours. Throughout the pandemic, WES has completed thousands of digital credential evaluations and documents. As of today, we\u2019ve resumed processing hard copy academic documents as well. Customers can <a href=\"https:\/\/applications.wes.org\/createaccount\">submit applications<\/a> and have their institutions send required documents to us by mail. A growing set of institutions can submit secure electronic documents directly to WES.<\/p>\n<p>As we move toward recovery, the vast majority of our staff continue to work from home, while a small dedicated team ensures that hard copy records are securely handled for credential evaluation. We are also working diligently to enable institutions around the globe to send us secure digital documents.<\/p>\n<p>We know that each application we receive represents the aspirations of an individual. We are committed to serving each as fully as possible. In the days ahead, we wish our partners, colleagues, and applicants well and we look forward to a shared and brighter future.<\/p>\n","page_maf":false,"alert_msg":"default","custom_body_class":"","hide_language_switcher":false,"custom_menu":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.3 (Yoast SEO v22.6) -
