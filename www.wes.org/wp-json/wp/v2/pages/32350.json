This bipartisan legislation would direct the United States Department of Labor to conduct an interagency study of the barriers that impact employment opportunities of immigrants and refugees who hold international credentials. <\/p>\n<p>Read the full sign-on letter urging members of Congress to co-sponsor the Improving Opportunities for New Americans Act: <\/p>\n<p>Dear Members of Congress, <\/p>\n<p>On behalf of more than 120 national, state, and local organizations, we write to express our support for\u202fThe Improving Opportunities for New Americans Act of 2021. This bipartisan legislation directs the United States Department of Labor (DOL) to study the barriers that lead to the underemployment and unemployment of immigrants and refugees who hold professional credentials earned in other countries. <\/p>\n<p>Immigrants, refugees, and asylees are eager to contribute their experience and training in the U.S. Yet because of systemic barriers, including the lack of recognition of their international education and experience, more than\u202ftwo million\u202fimmigrants with college degrees are underemployed or unemployed in the U.S.;\u202f60 percent\u202fof them have international credentials, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute. This underutilization of talent limits workforce diversity and robs us of the urgently needed social, cultural, and linguistic abilities of immigrant and refugee workers. It also results in nearly $39.4 billion in forgone earnings and $10 billion in unrealized tax payments. <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Sura Alsaffar, for example, spent 16 years practicing as a physician in both Syria and Iraq. She treated patients during extreme war conditions but was ultimately forced to flee as a refugee. Despite her extensive experience and efforts to successfully pass all three steps of the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), Dr. Alsaffar\u2019s medical career has stalled in the U.S. She earns $15 an hour as an administrative assistant; to re-enter the medical field, she is working with the job coaching non-profit Upwardly Global. As the COVID-19 pandemic strains the U.S. health sector and the nation faces a looming physician shortage, cumbersome barriers to licensure prevent qualified professionals like Dr. Alsaffar from re-establishing their careers. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cComing to the U.S. was a dream come true for us. We were so grateful to have the opportunity to move to a safe place. But our safety has also cost me my career. And it\u2019s been hard to sit on the sidelines during this pandemic, when I know that I have experience to contribute,\u201d Dr. Alsaffar says. <\/p>\n<p>Refugees and immigrants are vital to the prosperity of our communities, and their inclusion will be critical to the nation\u2019s economic recovery. In 2015 alone, nearly\u202f2.3 million refugees\u202fearned a collective\u202f$77.2 billion\u202fin household income, contributed\u202f$20.9 billion\u202fin taxes, and held\u202f$56.3 billion\u202fin spending power. Immigrants\u202fmake up more than\u202f16 percent\u202fof all U.S. health workers;\u202f8 percent\u202fof teachers;\u202f25 percent\u202fof the biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry; and\u202f25 percent\u202fof IT professionals. <\/p>\n<p>As the U.S. recovers and rebuilds, the need to integrate immigrants and refugees into the workforce is increasingly urgent.\u202fThe Improving Opportunities for New Americans Act of 2021\u202fmarks an important step in building a resilient workforce and robust economy, and we urge all members of Congress to co-sponsor this bill. <\/p>\n<p>Sincerely,
