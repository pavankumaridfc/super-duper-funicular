Accordingly, you understand and agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to assert or defend your rights. However, either you or WES may bring any individual claim in small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual claim. The term \u201cdispute\u201d means any dispute, action, claim, or other controversy between you and WES, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. \u201cDispute\u201d will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.<\/p>\n<h3>8.2 Informal Dispute Resolution<\/h3>\n<p>Either party asserting a dispute shall first try in good faith to resolve it by providing written notice as specified below to the other party describing the facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond. Notice shall be made by first class or registered mail (1) to WES Attention: Legal Department, Bowling Green Station, P.O.

You should include your printed name, mailing address, and the words \u201cReject Arbitration.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>8.4 How Arbitration Works<\/h3>\n<p>Either party may initiate arbitration, which shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available on the AAA\u2019s website www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879. In the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to hear the dispute, the parties shall agree to, or the court shall select, another arbitration provider. Unless you and WES agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing shall take place in the county of your residence (as determined by your billing address on file with WES). If you live outside the United States, any arbitration will take place in New York, New York. Except for a dispute determined to be initiated in bad faith or frivolous by the arbitrator, WES will pay all filing, administrative, arbitrator and hearing costs and waives any rights it may have to recover an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses against you.<\/p>\n<h3>8.5 Waiver of the Right to Bring Class Action and Representative Claims<\/h3>\n<p>All arbitrations shall proceed on an individual basis. The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the dispute with the same remedies available in court, including public injunctive relief. You and WES also agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in your or their respective individual capacities and in so doing you and WES hereby waive the right to a trial by jury, to assert or participate in any class action lawsuit or class action arbitration, any private attorney general lawsuit or private attorney general arbitration, and any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.<\/p>\n<h3>8.6 Governing Law and Other Terms<\/h3>\n<p>This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act and, where applicable, the law of the State of New York. WES will provide notice of any material changes to this Arbitration Agreement. The terms of this Arbitration Agreement shall survive after your relationship with WES and\/or use of the Services ends. Any arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p>Except as set forth above, if any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Agreement. Only the arbitrator is authorized to make determinations as to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this Agreement, including whether any dispute falls within its scope. However, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action\/representative waiver above must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the waiver.<\/p>\n<h3>8.7 Canada<\/h3>\n<p>In the event that this Arbitration Agreement or any other portion of this Section 8 is unenforceable by operation of the federal laws of Canada or the laws of any of the Canadian provinces therein (as and if applicable), all disputes, controversies and claims arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to the Services or these Terms and Conditions, as between any Canadian resident and WES, will be governed by, interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, and the applicable federal laws of Canada, excluding any rules of private international law or the conflicts of laws that would lead to the application of any other laws.<\/p>\n<h2>Section 9.
