Founded in 1974, WES evaluates and advocates for the recognition of international education qualifications, supports the integration of immigrants and refugees into the workforce, and provides philanthropic funding to immigrant- and refugee-serving organizations. Over more than 45 years, WES has provided credential evaluations to nearly three million individuals from around the globe.<\/p>\n<p>WES urges DHS to withdraw the above-referenced proposed regulation, which would unduly burden higher education institutions and international students across the U.S. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained international students and academic institutions to an unprecedented degree. Establishing new regulations while students and educational institutions are already under such tremendous pressure is unnecessary and misguided.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Background<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>DHS\u2019 proposed rule seeks to limit the length of time that international students and other temporary visa holders can remain in the U.S. The rule would change existing admission periods for international students and certain other non-immigrant visa holders from \u201cduration of status\u201d to fixed time periods. For international students, the rule proposes setting the authorized admission and extension periods as the length of the student\u2019s specific educational program, not to exceed a two- or four-year period plus a period of 30 days following their program end date.<\/p>\n<p>Although the proposed rule would permit certain students to seek an extension of status (EOS) beyond a two- or four-year admission period, it is unclear when or how such extensions would be granted. According to the proposal, students seeking a program extension must first request the extension from a designated school official (DSO). If the DSO recommends the extension, the student must then apply for an EOS from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Overall, the proposal would create a lengthy and opaque adjudication process for students and academic institutions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the proposed rule subjects some students to a limited two-year visa. To remain in the U.S. beyond the two-year period, students would be required to submit applications to USCIS for an extension of their stay. Those subject to the two-year limit include students born in or citizens of countries designated by the U.S. as state sponsors of terrorism or countries with a visa overstay rate of greater than 10 percent. The list of affected countries disproportionately impacts African nations and students. Others affected by the proposed rule\u2019s two-year limitation include international students attending unaccredited schools or schools that do not participate in the E-Verify program. Students participating in English language programs would also be limited to one lifetime two-year admission period.<\/p>\n<p>DHS also proposes to limit a student\u2019s period of stay to a maximum of two years based on certain other factors determined by DHS to be in the national interest. For example, the proposed rule, citing national security concerns, states that DHS could limit the length of admission of students enrolled in specific coursework, such as nuclear science. In addition to the maximum stay requirements proposed under the rule, DHS proposes to limit the number of times a student can change programs within an educational level.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to work authorization, the proposed rule does not provide an automatic extension of employment authorization while an application for an extension of stay is pending for students interning for an international organization, engaging in curricular practical training (CPT), or engaging in pre- or post-completion optional practical training (OPT). Under the proposed rule, CPT may not be granted for a period exceeding a student\u2019s fixed date of admission; a student cannot engage in CPT until USCIS approves a timely filed EOS request.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I. The proposed rule would harm international students, academic institutions, and the economy. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed rule would have a devastating impact on the ability of the U.S. to attract talent from around the world, and would undoubtedly exacerbate the current decreases in international student enrollment across the country.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/a> Such steep declines would lead to significant financial ramifications for higher education institutions and the U.S. economy. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates\u00a0that international students\u00a0contribute approximately $20 billion in tuition and\u00a0fees\u00a0to U.S.\u00a0academic institutions each\u00a0year.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/a> According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, international students contributed\u00a0$44.7 billion to the U.S. economy in 2018.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><sup>[3]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The proposed policy would also impose considerable financial burdens on international students and make their course of study in the U.S. unpredictable. According to DHS estimates, the additional costs of each extension of stay application could total more than $1,000. Furthermore, U.S. higher education institutions would be unable to provide incoming or prospective international students with assurances that they would be able to remain in the U.S. for the duration of their academic program. As a result, the U.S. could lose a critical pipeline of talented students.<\/p>\n<p>The proposed regulation would have a negative economic impact on academic institutions and would divert needed institutional resources to comply with a rule that offers no demonstrable benefits. DHS estimates that\u00a0training\u00a0and implementation\u00a0of the proposed rule would\u00a0cost higher education institutions hundreds of millions\u00a0of dollars over the next decade. However, these estimates significantly undervalue the actual costs of the proposed regulation.\u00a0For example, DHS\u2019 cost estimates do not account for the staffing required to advise students and\u00a0update internal systems and processes, nor do they account for\u00a0the anticipated loss in tuition revenue from projected declines in international student enrollments.\u00a0At a time when academic institutions already face significant revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these additional\u00a0compliance costs\u00a0coupled with a projected decrease in international student enrollment would have devastating financial consequences for the U.S. higher education system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>II.DHS has not demonstrated a compelling need for the proposed rule, nor that it is necessary to ensure compliance with visa regulations. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Through the existing <a href=\"https:\/\/studyinthestates.dhs.gov\/sevis-help-hub\">Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS)<\/a>, which tracks higher education institutions and international students, DHS can monitor detailed information on students during their time in the U.S. However, the proposed rule would require students to provide USCIS information that higher education institutions <em>already provide<\/em> through SEVIS. In addition, DHS presently has the authority under current regulations to request additional information from higher education institutions to ensure compliance with visa requirements. Accordingly, the extension of stay process proposed under this rule is an unnecessary and inefficient use of government resources.<\/p>\n<p>DHS has not demonstrated a legitimate need for the proposed two-year admission limits for international students from nations that DHS has designated as having more than 10 percent visa overstay rates\u2014the vast majority of which are African nations. DHS relies on flawed data to justify the proposed two-year maximum stay. Specifically, the data include not only estimates of visa overstay rates, but also estimates of individuals whom DHS could not identify as having departed the U.S.,<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><sup>[4]<\/sup><\/a> thus skewing the visa overstay rate.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, the proposed rule seeks to limit the amount of time international students who attend institutions that do not participate in the E-Verify program can remain in the U.S. The E-Verify program, which has been widely criticized for its error rates and for misidentifying eligible workers as ineligible to work in the U.S., should not form the basis for limiting international students to two-year visas.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><sup>[5]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>III. The proposed rule usurps the role of educational institutions in academic decision-making.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>DHS proposes to eliminate the \u201cnormal progress\u201d standard with respect to seeking a program extension. The proposed new standard for requesting an extension of status for additional time to complete a program would require: (1) compelling academic reasons; (2) a documented illness or medical condition; or (3) exceptional circumstances. This proposal would encroach on the autonomy of higher education institutions to determine whether and when to grant students additional time to complete a degree. Immigration officers are not qualified to make assessments of students\u2019 academic progress. Furthermore, the \u201ccompelling academic reasons\u201d standard is not clearly defined by the proposed rule, giving the federal government unfettered discretion to determine whether a student has made adequate academic progress, which could lead to inconsistent and unfair outcomes for students across the U.S.<\/p>\n<p><strong>IV. The proposed fixed periods for student admissions do not conform to academic programs and fail to address students\u2019 reliance interests on current policy.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed rule fundamentally alters the agreement between students and institutions midway through the program and fails to provide international students sufficient time to complete degrees in many academic programs, including doctoral programs, surgery residencies, neuroscience postdoctoral programs, joint degree programs, bachelor\u2019s\/master\u2019s programs. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), bachelor\u2019s students\u00a0needed\u00a0more than four years to complete their degrees in the 2015\/16 academic year.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\"><sup>[6]<\/sup><\/a> Similarly, many students\u00a0interested in acquiring practical experience through the\u00a0OPT or CPT programs would be unable to do so without approved extensions from USCIS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>V. The proposed rule would exacerbate existing processing delays at USCIS.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The proposed regulation is unworkable because of the uncertainty it creates and the lengthy processing times for extension of stay applications. Currently,\u00a0extension\u00a0requests for international student visas\u00a0can take more than seven months to process. According to DHS estimates the proposed rule would require\u00a0USCIS\u00a0to\u00a0process\u00a0hundreds of thousands of\u00a0extension of stay requests for international students\u00a0each year. This volume of work would dramatically increase waiting times\ufffc worsening\ufffc existing backlogs at USCIS, and resulting in uncertainty, disruption, and harm to students and their academic institutions Increasing the number of applications USCIS must adjudicate when the agency is already facing massive backlogs and a severe budget crisis would further undermine the agency\u2019s mission.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WES urges DHS to withdraw the proposed regulation which would have a detrimental effect on students, academic institutions, and communities. Instead, WES recommends that current regulations relating to duration of status for international students remain in effect.
