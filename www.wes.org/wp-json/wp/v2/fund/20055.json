The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare intersectional challenges of record unemployment, structural inequalities in the economy, and systemic racism that largely left people of color, including many immigrants and refugees, to bear the brunt of the impact, amplifying the urgency of fostering immigrant and refugee workforce inclusion.\u00a0<\/span><span
