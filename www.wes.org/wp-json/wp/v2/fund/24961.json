In the United States, the IRC provides opportunities for refugees, asylees, victims of human trafficking, survivors of torture, and other immigrants to thrive. Each year, thousands of people who were forced to flee violence and persecution are welcomed into the United States. Working with government bodies, civil society actors, and local volunteers, the IRC helps these people translate their past experiences into assets\u00a0and skills\u00a0that are valuable to their new communities.<\/p>\n<h4>What type of work will the grant enable?<\/h4>\n<p>The\u00a0IRC\u00a0is\u00a0working\u00a0in four cities\u00a0to\u00a0strengthen\u00a0local\u00a0workforce systems and\u00a0support successful career pathways for\u00a0immigrant and refugee workers.\u00a0In four\u00a0distinct\u00a0economies\u2014Seattle; San Diego; Boise, Idaho; and Atlanta\u2014the IRC will illuminate how local policies and decisions affect the economic outcomes of refugees and immigrants.\u00a0Additionally, the grant is helping to fund the IRC\u2019s COVID-19 relief work and provide direct assistance to workers\u00a0economically affected by COVID-19.<\/p>\n<h4>Why is this work important?<\/h4>\n<p>COVID-19 has exposed the long-standing reality for immigrants,\u00a0refugees,\u00a0people of color, and many other workers, that workforce systems are not set up for these workers\u2019 success, and many are being left\u00a0behind.\u00a0At the same time, all\u00a0economies\u00a0are local, and different cities\u00a0have different economic needs. The IRC\u2019s work across four cities will help\u00a0identify\u00a0overarching\u00a0best practices, policies, and workforce\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0that support the success of refugees and immigrants, while also determining what\u2019s required to implement these\u00a0best practices\u00a0in a\u00a0contextually specific way.\u00a0This project seeks to help identify career paths\u00a0that enable these workers to\u00a0learn industry-specific skills in their communities based on local economic needs.\u00a0Immigrant workers need\u00a0supportive and inclusive workforce systems that consider how to meet the needs of all workers across occupations, skills, and education.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":24993,"template":"","grant_category":[],"better_featured_image":{"id":24993,"alt_text":"","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":850,"height":570,"file":"2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0.png","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-300x201.png","width":300,"height":201,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-300x201.png"},"thumbnail":{"file":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-150x150.png","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-150x150.png"},"medium_large":{"file":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-768x515.png","width":768,"height":515,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-768x515.png"},"team":{"file":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-185x185.png","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-185x185.png"},"people":{"file":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-394x276.png","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-394x276.png"},"insight":{"file":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-541x362.png","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0-541x362.png"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":24961,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0.png"},"acf":{"article_image":{"ID":24993,"id":24993,"title":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0","filename":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0.png","filesize":256171,"url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0.png","link":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/fund\/grantee\/international-rescue-committee\/wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0\/","alt":"","author":"49","description":"","caption":"","name":"wes-fund-grantee-partner-850x570-irc0","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":24961,"date":"2020-06-18
