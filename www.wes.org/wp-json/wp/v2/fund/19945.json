To deepen and scale career pathways and workforce solutions, JFF is working directly with companies that value workplace diversity and inclusion. Insights from this work will be shared broadly and leveraged to encourage other employers to put talent first and invest in the success of immigrant and refugee workers.<\/p>\n<h4>Why is this work important to the Fund?<\/h4>\n<p>The work that JFF is carrying out resonates deeply with the WES Mariam Assefa Fund\u2019s goal of urging more employers to adopt and invest in programs, practices, and behaviors that support immigrant and refugee talent. Leveraging its robust network of \u201cimpact employers\u201d\u2014businesses that adopt strategies with a positive impact on workers, communities, and the bottom line\u2014JFF is testing the validity and effectiveness of interventions such as on-the-job ESOL classes and skills training. It is also measuring the effects of such interventions on the company as well as on workers. As seen in the case of Denver-based L&amp;R Pallet, which has a 66 percent refugee labor force, employee productivity and retention improve with on-the-job training and support. JFF\u2019s project is also formalizing internal pathways for professional advancement, and creating economic mobility for low-income immigrant and refugee workers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":20215,"template":"","grant_category":[809,810],"better_featured_image":{"id":20215,"alt_text":"","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":1200,"height":680,"file":"2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1.png","sizes":{"medium":{"file":"fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-300x170.png","width":300,"height":170,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-300x170.png"},"large":{"file":"fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-1024x580.png","width":1024,"height":580,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-1024x580.png"},"thumbnail":{"file":"fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-150x150.png","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-150x150.png"},"medium_large":{"file":"fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-768x435.png","width":768,"height":435,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-768x435.png"},"team":{"file":"fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-185x185.png","width":185,"height":185,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-185x185.png"},"people":{"file":"fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-394x276.png","width":394,"height":276,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-394x276.png"},"insight":{"file":"fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-541x362.png","width":541,"height":362,"mime-type":"image\/png","source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1-541x362.png"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":19945,"source_url":"https:\/\/www.wes.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/fund-grantee-profiles-socialmedia-jff-1.png"},"acf":{"grant_category":"Employer Practices","grant_amount":"USD$247,380","grant_term":"Sept. 2019\u2014December 2021","grant_focus":"JFF is identifying emerging practices that enable employers to support immigrant and refugee workers and expanding employer-driven workforce training programs for further replication.
